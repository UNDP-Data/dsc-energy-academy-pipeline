This globalization of energy markets has profound implications for energy governance, as decision-making is influenced not just by national policies but also by international agreements, multinational corporations, and financial institutions.\nTechnological Innovation and Market Liberalization: The rise of distributed energy resources, digitalization, and clean energy transitions has disrupted traditional governance structures, requiring more dynamic regulatory frameworks.\nIncreased Role of Civil Society and Non-State Actors: NGOs, advocacy groups, and local communities are now key players in shaping policy and holding governments accountable for sustainable and equitable energy transitions"
