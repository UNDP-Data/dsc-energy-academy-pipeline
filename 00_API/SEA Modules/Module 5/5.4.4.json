Before diving into the specific governance issues, we first explore the elements of this framework."

Legal and regulatory inconsistencies\u2014such as conflicting fossil fuel and renewable energy policies\u2014also emerged as significant concerns.\nCivic engagement and transparency remain weak, with minimal inclusion of local communities, women, and marginalized groups in shaping Nigeria\u2019s Energy Transition Plan (ETP). Stakeholders also noted power imbalances in land ownership and resource control, which could impact equitable access to energy transition benefits.\nFinancial governance was less discussed, but concerns were raised about rushed investments in critical minerals, lack of transparency in climate finance, and limited awareness of carbon markets.\nRead here for more insights!"
