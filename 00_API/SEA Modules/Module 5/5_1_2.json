These include high upfront capital costs, perceived financial risks, and limited access to affordable financing, particularly in developing countries where institutional and financial infrastructures may be weaker. Addressing these barriers requires de-risking strategies, policy guarantees, and innovative financing mechanisms to attract private investment and enable an equitable energy transition."

Systems of rules like constitutions or trade treaties establish limits on behaviour. Not all rule systems are formally encoded as law. Informal institutions serve the same purpose and should not be seen as weak or irrelevant. Indeed, in many developing contexts, informal rules that relate to things like kinship or patronage politics can matter more than formal rules written into law. Whether informal or formalized through laws and policies, gender relations are also systems that shape and/or constrain behaviour of individuals as well as of institutions."
