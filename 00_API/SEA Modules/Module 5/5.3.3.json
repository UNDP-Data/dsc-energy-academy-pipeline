The actual process of policy formulation and implementation needs to be engendered. Increased participation of women in the energy sector and improvement of their status relative to men can help to incorporate gender as an integral part of energy policies and practices.\n4. Collect and use disaggregated data. In each step of the policy process, policymakers should specifically address how their decisions will differently impact various population subgroups. This requires use of data sets disaggregated by sex and other social and economic variables to determine who is using what forms of energy to do what."

However, budgetary allocations have the power to transform gender inequalities. One approach to ensuring that the needs of women as well as men are met is for government budgets to be gender disaggregated. Gender budgeting is a tool that can be used to break down and identify the differentiated impacts of public revenue allocations and expenditures as they affect men and women.\n6. Define the elements of gender-sensitive energy policies and advocate for gender-sensitivity in the energy policy-making processes. Like any sectoral policy, energy policy has a multidimensional character: it contains political, economic, environmental, and social elements. Each of these elements has a gender dimension. The four general aspects of energy policy listed above need to be correlated with three issues that lie at the heart of women\u2019s energy needs: availability, affordability, and safety. There are a number of different, sometimes overlapping, rationales for incorporating gender sensitivity into energy policies, and different stakeholders may be more or less responsive to different arguments and viewpoints."
