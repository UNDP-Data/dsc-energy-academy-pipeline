Regulatory authorities may monitor market behavior, set tariffs, ensure fair competition, and protect consumer rights. For example, an energy regulator might investigate market abuses or mandate service quality standards, using various tools\u2014including audits\u2014as part of its enforcement strategy.\nIn parallel, external and independent audits serve as important instruments to verify financial and operational integrity. These audits, which may be conducted by independent bodies or mandated by regulators, assess whether energy companies are complying with legal and financial obligations. For instance, audits of distribution companies can uncover fraudulent practices such as \u201cshadow employment\u201d or misreporting of losses. While audits are sometimes initiated by regulators, they are distinct from regulatory powers and serve as a complementary accountability mechanism.\nFinally, parliamentary committees or civil society watchdogs may conduct additional oversight\u2014examining whether energy policies are being implemented as intended, whether public funds are used efficiently, and whether reforms are delivering on equity and access goals."
