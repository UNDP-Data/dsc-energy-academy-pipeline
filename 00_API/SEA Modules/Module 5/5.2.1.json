              "text": "Although not part pf the framework by the UNEP, building administrative capacity is another vital mechanism for policy coherence in sustainable development. Weak institutional frameworks, especially at the local level, can hinder energy sector reforms and policy implementation, particularly in vertically integrated utilities facing financial strain. Strengthening capacity through training and technical support ensures more effective policy execution and greater alignment in energy transitions, overcoming obstacles to sustainable governance."
