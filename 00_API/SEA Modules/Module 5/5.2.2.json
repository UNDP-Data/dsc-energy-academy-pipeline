It supports initiatives like the G20 agenda by enhancing capacity in Emerging and Developing Market Economies to link energy planning with financial strategies for the transition. The LTES Network brings institutional support to its benefit around three areas: IRENA’s LTES program includes workshops, regional events, and thematic webinars. In 2024, the webinar series \"Energy Planning Frameworks for Mobilizing Finance for the Energy Transition\" aims to connect energy planners and financial institutions to de-risk investments and improve collaboration. The series address leveraging planning frameworks to enhance investment outcomes and project feasibility while aligning with the G20 Energy Transition Working Group priorities."
