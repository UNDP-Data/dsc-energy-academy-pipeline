However, the climate crisis has introduced a third critical dimension\u2014sustainability\u2014transforming the mandate of energy regulators and reshaping energy governance. This shift is unfolding amid deep global inequalities and increasing instability.\nFor the first time in over 30 years, the Human Development Index (HDI)  declined for two consecutive years, 2020 and 2021, erasing gains from the previous five years. \u00a0This decline is attributed to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which have exacerbated poverty and inequality. Concurrently, many societies are experiencing heightened political and social polarization."
