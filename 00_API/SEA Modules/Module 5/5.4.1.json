This trust is vital for public acceptance of energy policies, especially when such policies require significant behavioral or economic adjustments from the populace. Facilitating Investment Transparent markets attract investors by reducing informational asymmetries and perceived risks. Investors are more likely to fund renewable energy projects when they have clear insights into regulatory frameworks, financial incentives, and market operations. Promoting Efficient Resource Allocation Transparency ensures that resources allocated for the energy transition are used effectively. It allows for the monitoring of fund disbursement and project execution, thereby minimizing waste and mismanagement."

Bribery and Cronyism Corruption can infiltrate the procurement processes of energy projects, leading to the selection of contractors based on favoritism rather than merit.

Promote Adoption and Implementation of Anti-Corruption Instruments Countries should ratify and align national policies with global and regional frameworks such as the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). Development partners can support legal harmonization and institutional strengthening to uphold these commitments. Provide Capacity-Building for Fund Administration Invest in the capacity of ministries, national funds, and procurement bodies to manage climate and energy finance transparently. This includes adopting digital public financial management systems, modern procurement platforms, and training programs. Consolidate and Streamline Funding Channels Reduce fragmentation in funding structures by establishing unified financing platforms, integrating reporting systems, and ensuring centralized oversight.
