Its interpretation varies across different social, economic, and political contexts. At its core, a just transition seeks to balance the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions with the responsibility to ensure that both the benefits and burdens of this shift are distributed equitably.\nThis lesson will explore how a just transition goes beyond technical solutions and policy frameworks\u2014it is about addressing deep-rooted socio-economic disparities, fostering participatory governance, and empowering all stakeholders as active agents of change. It emphasizes equal access to the benefits of the transition, such as clean energy and energy security, ensuring they are not limited to certain regions or privileged groups but are shared across all of society."

                "text": "The concept of a just transition originated in the 1980s through  advocacy by global trade unions, which sought to safeguard workers  displaced by environmental regulations, exemplified by initiatives like  the \"Superfund for Workers\" to support fossil fuel industry employees.\nAccording to the International Labour Organization (ILO, 2024) , a just transition involves greening the economy in a manner that maximizes fairness and inclusivity for all stakeholders.  Equity must be integrated into policies and strategies, with inclusivity serving as a guiding principle to engage every community, worker, and social group in decision-making processes (Sovacool et al., 2017).   This approach aims to generate decent work opportunities, leaving no one behind in the process.\r\nHowever, contemporary scholarship has expanded this framework beyond labor-centric concerns to integrate climate, energy, and environmental justice, ensuring inclusivity for historically marginalized groups, Indigenous  communities, and regions disproportionately impacted by both climate change and transition policies."

                "text": "Raphael Heffron, a leading scholar in this field, argues that a just transition requires a \"triumvirate of justice tenets\": distributional equity (fair resource allocation), procedural fairness (inclusive decision-making), and restorative measures (addressing historical harms) (Heffron & de Fontenelle, 2024). This approach moves beyond the ILO\u2019s traditional focus on labor rights to emphasize multisectoral equity, aligning with the Paris Agreement\u2019s call for holistic climate action. For instance, Heffron\u2019s work highlights the need to repurpose fossil fuel infrastructure while  ensuring communities dependent on extractive industries receive  retraining, renewable job opportunities, and participatory governance.\nCritically, the transition must reconcile global climate goals with localized realities. Poorly contextualized policies risk exacerbating inequalities,  particularly in the Global South, where energy demand grows alongside  entrenched poverty (McCauley & Heffron, 2018). Effective  strategies involve decentralizing decision-making to engage local  stakeholders\u2014governments, businesses, Indigenous leaders, and civil society\u2014in designing context-specific solutions, such as community-owned solar microgrids or gender-inclusive green job programs. By prioritizing restorative justice and participatory frameworks, the transition can transcend tokenistic inclusivity, ensuring environmental  sustainability and socio-economic equity are mutually reinforcing"
