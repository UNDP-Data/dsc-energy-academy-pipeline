Different criteria may apply depending on whether the focus is on supporting consumption or facilitating energy connections. Policymakers must determine whether support necessitates one or multiple targeting strategies and ESN mechanisms. Accurate household energy consumption data are vital for determining appropriate subsidy levels and benefits. Policymakers require robust evidence on energy consumption patterns to develop tailored and effective ESN programs. Enhanced quantitative research, improved data gathering techniques, and thorough analysis of household energy consumption and expenditure are imperative for informing energy and social protection policies. ESNs must align with the institutional, geographic, and economic context of the country to be effective. Social assistance and ESN initiatives should continually evolve to adapt to shifting social and economic landscapes. Additionally, gender dynamics in energy management within households should be considered, with ESNs designed to promote women's empowerment in energy management."

Research results support the assertion that social safety nets and income support programs play a crucial role in poverty alleviation during energy transitions. Studies have consistently shown that targeted energy subsidies effectively mitigate the impact of rising energy costs on vulnerable populations. For instance, a study by IEA found that well-designed energy subsidies contribute to enhanced energy access for low-income households while supporting the transition to cleaner energy sources. Similarly, income support programs have demonstrated their effectiveness in stabilizing the economic well-being of individuals during times of transition. Research by ILO highlights the importance of income support in preventing the exacerbation of inequalities and reducing the risk of social unrest during periods of economic change. This research underscores the role of income support as a vital tool in addressing poverty-related challenges associated with energy transitions."

Research by the World Bank emphasizes that effective social safety nets contribute to poverty reduction by ensuring a basic standard of living for vulnerable populations facing economic hardships during the energy transition. By preventing income disparities and addressing unemployment, these programs contribute to social stability and reduce the risk of social unrest. Social stability during energy transitions is a crucial outcome facilitated by the strategic implementation of social safety nets and income support programs. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) emphasizes the stabilizing role of social safety nets by mitigating income inequality during economic transitions driven by the changing energy landscape. These programs act as a safeguard not only for individual financial well-being but also for maintaining a more equitable distribution of resources within society, thereby promoting social stability."

This research underscores the vital link between income support programs and social stability, particularly during times of economic transition (IMF, 2024) Moreover, investigations into the social outcomes of income disparities highlight the potential for social instability when economic inequalities persist. Income inequality is associated with various social issues, including heightened crime rates, reduced social trust, and increased levels of social unrest. In the context of the energy transition, income support programs emerge as essential tools for preventing and alleviating the adverse social consequences linked to income disparities. For instance, Uruguayâ€™s National Social Emergency Response Plan (PANES) targeted the poorest 20 percent of households and helped many at risk to increase their income and improve their employment opportunities."

The implementation of targeted energy subsidies is grounded in the recognition that low-income communities or individuals often face heightened challenges in adapting to cleaner but potentially more expensive energy sources. As utility bills increase, these vulnerable populations face increasing energy burdens, often having to make difficult tradeoffs between paying for food, medicine, and energy. Appropriate support mechanisms for such populations in the form of equitable tariff designs and targeted incentives for energy efficiency upgrades and clean energy technologies are essential for ensuring a just transition. It is necessary for these energy subsidies to be targeted because if they are not, richer households benefit disproportionately from them, given they consume more transport fuels and electricity. Currently, most energy subsidies in the world are indeed regressive in nature, meaning that often more than 50% of the total benefit is received by the wealthiest segments of the population. Research does consistently underscore the importance of targeted subsidies in fostering inclusivity."

One of the primary ways in which targeted energy subsidies foster inclusivity is by ensuring that the costs associated with the adoption of cleaner energy technologies do not disproportionately impact those with limited financial resources. By providing financial relief or discounts on cleaner energy alternatives, subsidies make it more feasible for low-income communities to participate actively in the transition process. This not only addresses immediate affordability concerns but also contributes to the broader goal of reducing energy poverty. Moreover, targeted energy subsidies play a role in leveling the playing field and preventing the widening of existing socio-economic disparities. Without such measures, the transition to cleaner energy sources might inadvertently exacerbate inequalities, as higher costs associated with new technologies could further marginalize low-income communities. The subsidies, therefore, act as a means of social justice, ensuring that the benefits of the energy transition are distributed equitably."
