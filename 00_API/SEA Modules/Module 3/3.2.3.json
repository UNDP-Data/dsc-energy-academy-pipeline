Income inequality is associated with various social issues, including heightened crime rates, reduced social trust, and increased levels of social unrest. In the context of the energy transition, income support programs emerge as essential tools for preventing and alleviating the adverse social consequences linked to income disparities.

As utility bills increase, these vulnerable populations face increasing energy burdens, often having to make difficult tradeoffs between paying for food, medicine, and energy.  Appropriate support mechanisms for such populations in the form of equitable tariff designs and targeted incentives for energy efficiency upgrades and clean energy technologies are essential for ensuring a just transition. \r\nIt is necessary for these energy subsidies to be targeted because if they are not, richer households benefit disproportionately from them, given they consume more transport fuels and electricity. Currently, most energy subsidies in the world are indeed regressive in nature, meaning that often more than 50% of the total benefit is received by the wealthiest segments of the population.  Research does consistently underscore the importance of targeted subsidies in fostering inclusivity."
