              "text": "Module 3 examines the Just Energy Transition, focusing on the shift to a low-carbon economy while ensuring its benefits are widely shared, leaving no one behind. It addresses the environmental and social challenges of transitioning from a carbon-based economy to renewable energy, with an emphasis on protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring fairness for the global south. The module explores the shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy, particularly within decentralised systems, and highlights the transformative potential of community-led initiatives. It underscores that social, economic, and environmental justice are central to the transition, recognising that a one-size-fits-all approach is not feasible. Inclusive processes that consider local and regional contexts are promoted, with a critical analysis of the role of extractive industries in shaping energy landscapes. The module highlights the need for tailored approaches, acknowledging that paths to a just transition differ across local realities. Beyond environmental concerns, it also focuses on worker retraining, social safety nets, and economic diversification, ensuring the well-being of workers and affected communities remains at the heart of the transition to sustainable energy."
