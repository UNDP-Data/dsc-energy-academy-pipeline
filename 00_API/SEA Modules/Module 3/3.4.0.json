It emphasizes the need for comprehensive, integrated approaches that address the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of the transition, ensuring no one is left behind.\nKey themes include the importance of proactive planning, strategic foresight, and the transformation of physical infrastructure to enhance resilience and equity. The chapter also highlights the role of Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) as innovative financing mechanisms to support developing countries in shifting from fossil fuels to clean energy. Case studies, such as Zimbabwe\u2019s employment impact modeling, illustrate how data-driven assessments and inclusive stakeholder engagement can inform effective policy development. The chapter underscores the necessity of transparency, equity, and international cooperation to achieve sustainable and just energy transitions."
