First, the Hydro Energy Reborn project consists of acquiring, resorting, and generating electricity through existing hydroelectric plants. \nSecond, the Community Resilience through Photovoltaic Energy project focuses on forgotten and ignored citizens who were without power for more than one year. As a community resilience program, it ensures that residents of the most remote areas have access to electricity after the next natural disaster and, under normal conditions, cost-effective electricity with a fixed price. Lastly, the Microgrid of the Mountain project better serves the energy needs of the people of Cordillera Central with cost-effective and resilient electric power from renewable sources by providing residents with greater energy resilience to natural disasters."

This ensures that they receive affordable, resilient energy while actively participating in the decision-making processes that shape their energy future. By addressing the inequities caused by unreliable electricity, the initiative supports the economic development of the region, creating both direct and indirect job opportunities for local residents. This approach aligns with the principles of a just energy transition, which prioritizes community involvement, equity, and long-term sustainability, ensuring that the benefits of the energy transition are shared fairly and inclusively.\nThere are key lessons learned from these projects: the Hydro Energy Reborn project and the Community Resilience through Photovoltaic Energy project focus on governance and community, while the Microgrid of the Mountain project demonstrates how best to utilize existing resources. In the Hydro Energy Reborn project, collaborative governance was crucial; the scope of the initiative improved when municipalities came together and participated in sharing responsibilities. The benefits emerged from utilizing the electricity generated within the community, which kept control of those resources in the hands of the residents."

By retaining ownership and including leasing arrangements in the Community Resilience through Photovoltaic Energy project, residents were shielded from volatile energy costs and had a vested interest in the long-term success of the project.\nThese projects integrated local expertise and knowledge, harnessing local talent. The initiatives utilized resources and involved community members in decision-making processes, ensuring that the solutions were tailored to the specific needs and priorities of those communities. As the projects matured, it became clear that there was a strong need for political leaders representing the residents in the service area to come together to help accelerate the development of the projects. Fostering these partnerships is a way to overcome institutional barriers and achieve greater impact. Lastly, the Microgrid of the Mountain project exemplified the potential of leveraging existing resources for community resilience by revitalizing underused hydroelectric plants. This approach would result in little to no negative impact on the environment or the initial investment because these hydroelectric plants are already built. All that remains is to optimize and maximize the existing resources."
