Multilateral environmental governance, for instance, fosters accountability among actors by encouraging countries to increase their designated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), as outlined in the Paris Agreement (Averchenkova & Chan, 2023).\nPrior to 2023, the principles of just energy transition were already embedded in 38% of NDCs and 56% of long-term strategies (LTS), underscoring a growing recognition of the importance of equity and inclusivity in climate action (UNFCCC, 2023). Effective governance strategies must uphold these principles, ensuring that the transition to clean energy benefits all members of society, with a commitment to leaving no one behind."

Developing countries face a particularly daunting task as they grapple with the need for hard data to anticipate changes and demonstrate the overwhelming benefits of transitioning to a green economy. This transition holds promise not only for environmental sustainability but also for achieving a just transition for society as a whole.\nTo bridge this data gap and facilitate evidence-based just transition planning, the UNDP's Climate Promise initiative has been instrumental in guiding countries. Through qualitative and quantitative assessments, including modelling techniques, countries can estimate the impacts of NDCs on key socioeconomic indicators such as GDP, employment, skills, income distribution, and gender equality. These assessments enable countries to gain insights into the distributional impacts of NDCs and identify targeted measures to ensure a just transition, particularly for vulnerable populations such as women and informal workers."

Building upon this foundational work, efforts are underway to expand the scope of assessments to encompass broader socioeconomic implications associated with implementing NDCs and LTS.\nIn Serbia, for example, a qualitative baseline analysis was undertaken as part of a just transition study focusing on coal-intensive regions and communities. This study, informed by international best practices, provides an overview of key considerations and offers a comprehensive seven-step roadmap along with follow-up actions to ensure a just transition.\nBy leveraging such assessments and strategies, countries can navigate the complexities of transitioning to a green economy while leaving no one behind, thereby fostering sustainable development and social equity."

Through targeted support and collaboration, governments, alongside organizations like UNDP, can spearhead efforts to foster inclusive and sustainable development in alignment with the principles of a just transition.\nThe patchwork of international and transnational initiatives underscores the need for greater coherence to foster responsible, sustainable, and transparent supply chains. While there has been a growing recognition of the challenges associated with the critical materials supply chain, the proliferation of voluntary initiatives and regulatory frameworks by governments, businesses, and civil society groups has resulted in a fragmented landscape of standards. This fragmentation risks sowing confusion among stakeholders and underscores the imperative for enhanced visibility and coherence."
