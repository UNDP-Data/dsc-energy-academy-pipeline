Despite this, recent scenarios suggest that job creation will outpace losses. By 2030, 103 million new jobs could be created under sustainable energy and circular economy models. In 2022 alone, the global renewable energy sector added 1 million jobs, with solar photovoltaic (PV) leading this growth.

The challenge lies in the limited overlap between fossil fuel and clean energy jobs, both geographically and in terms of job quality. This gap threatens to leave workers behind and could undermine political support for the energy transition.\nTo counter this, it is essential to leverage the entire clean energy value chain, such as localizing critical mineral supply chains and fostering downstream activities beyond extraction. This approach can create new jobs and build community support. However, a seamless transition from fossil fuel to clean energy roles is not always feasible. Therefore, supporting broader economic diversification, particularly in countries reliant on single industries, is crucial."

Employers struggled to find qualified workers across key sectors, such as energy, textiles, and construction. EVN, an Austrian electricity company, urgently needed 500 electrical fitters, leaders in the textile sector were delaying the adoption of technology because of a shortage of qualified technicians, and the construction industry sought 600 technicians. Education needed to be prepared to meet the challenges of gasification and the renewable energy sector. Private sector employers were proposing to suspend foreign investment until the skills shortages were resolved. The shortage of skilled workers was therefore hampering job creation, productivity improvements and competitiveness in North Macedonia[2]."

While employment opportunities in the clean energy sector are growing, they are unevenly distributed across the globe. Developing a sufficiently large and skilled local workforce is imperative in every region, as most energy jobs are tied to the location where installations are developed (IEA, 2023).\nChina holds a widening lead in renewable energy deployment and dominates equipment manufacturing, creating a significant share of high-quality jobs. The EU and countries such as the United States, India, Brazil are also major installers, working to strengthen domestic supply chains for greater local value creation. However, this concentration of high-quality jobs in developed countries further exacerbates global inequalities, leaving many developing regions behind.\nSkilled labor shortages are already evident in the clean energy sector, particularly in construction roles, which account for nearly half of new energy jobs.

Women are more prone than men to exit both the energy sector and the labor market altogether, underscoring the imperative of dismantling barriers hindering their participation and career progression, as revealed by data from the IEA Gender and Energy Data Explorer (2023). \r\nThe impending shifts in labor dynamics driven by climate change carry profound gender ramifications, bearing significant policy implications. Failure to implement measures bolstering women\u2019s engagement in emerging green vocations risks perpetuating existing gender stereotypes, thereby constricting women's access to the burgeoning job market. Hence, the adoption of \"gender-transformative\" reskilling initiatives spanning various proficiency levels emerges as a requisite to broaden women's pathways to novel employment prospects."

Increasing examples of women entrepreneurs in decentralized renewable energy (DRE) and productive uses of renewable energy (PURE) sectors offer lessons for a gender-just energy transition in rural regions. Scholarships, mentorship endeavours, capacity-building initiatives, and access to financing and other enabling conditions stand as linchpins in upskilling women and dismantling gender stereotypes prevalent within the energy sector.\r\nMoreover, the disproportionate burden of unpaid care work borne by women  raises formidable barriers to their ingress into clean energy employment and entrepreneurship. Absent supportive policies such as flexible work arrangements or childcare provisions, women risk encountering additional hurdles in accessing clean energy avenues.  Addressing these challenges transcends mere gender equality; it is pivotal for optimizing the effectiveness and longevity of clean energy initiatives, as women's insights pave the way for more innovative and inclusive outcomes."
