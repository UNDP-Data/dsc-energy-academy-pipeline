A 2022 study recalculated the SCC at $185 per ton of CO2, significantly higher than previous estimates.

These pollutants are linked to various health problems, including respiratory diseases and heart conditions. For example, natural gas combustion produces an average of 7.6 pounds of particulate matter emissions and 0.6 pounds of sulfur dioxide emissions per million standard cubic feet of natural gas combusted. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that outdoor air pollution causes around 4.2 million premature deaths annually, primarily from diseases such as stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory infections. In contrast, renewable energy systems generate virtually no air pollution during operation, with emissions occurring mainly during their construction, manufacturing, and transportation."

Traditional biomass and kerosene use release black carbon, a major contributor to indoor air pollution and severe respiratory illnesses, particularly in low-income households. Transitioning to cleaner energy sources for both electricity and cooking can significantly improve public health and reduce environmental harm. The air quality benefits of renewable energy are clear. If the world adopts renewable energy and limits global warming to 1.5°C, air pollutant emissions in 2050 could fall by up to 90% compared to 2022 levels. Similarly, global premature deaths and disabilities could go down by 86% in 2025 compared to 2022. This would prevent up to 5.13 million excess deaths annually, according to a 2023 study. This reduction in pollution would have a significant impact on public health. Like with GHG emissions, renewable energy generates economic value by reducing air pollutant emissions and its associated economic costs."

Fossil fuel power plants were responsible for a large portion of this water use. Coal plants alone withdrew 189.6 billion cubic meters of water. In contrast, renewable energy technologies used just 12.1 billion cubic meters in 2021. As such, solar panels and wind turbines do not require water for cooling or steam production, using it only for cleaning and construction, significantly reducing overall water consumption. However, geothermal energy does require water as a heat transfer fluid in the form of steam or hot water to generate electricity or provide direct heating, making its water use higher than other renewables."
