It can be harnessed through various technologies, such as solar photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), and solar thermal systems. Solar PV technology is the most widespread, transforming sunlight into electricity via silicon semiconductors. However, PV systems require battery storage to retain electricity for nighttime use. In 2023, solar PV accounted for three-quarters of all renewable power capacity additions, with global capacity reaching a record 473 gigawatts. CSP, on the other hand, uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight, generating heat for power production, and it can store energy for use at night. In 2020, CSP\u2019s installed capacity reached 7 gigawatts, showing significant growth since 2010."

Additionally, the cost of solar panels has dramatically dropped, with prices falling 93% from 2010 to 2020, making solar power the most affordable energy source in many regions.\n\nThe solar energy market has driven job creation as well. In 2023, approximately 7.1 million people were employed in solar PV, with China, dominating the workforce with 4.6 million jobs. Employment in clean energy continued to surpass fossil fuel jobs, reaching 34.8 million positions compared to 32.6 million in the fossil fuel sector."

                "text": "Wind power harnesses the kinetic energy of the wind through turbines that convert it into electrical energy, producing minimal greenhouse gas emissions compared to other energy sources. Over the past decade, wind technology has seen significant innovations, improving efficiency, power, and capacity while reducing noise. Wind installations now include onshore, offshore, and floating platforms capable of withstanding extreme conditions, such as hurricane-force winds. Offshore wind, with its stronger and more consistent winds, is expected to grow as siting challenges are addressed. Wind power currently accounts for 6-7% of global electricity, with substantial potential to meet global energy needs.\nWind energy is a crucial component of global climate strategies, particularly under the IEA Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario, as emphasized in the UAE Consensus, which calls for doubling energy efficiency and tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030. In 2022, wind power grew by 17%, contributing to a combined 12% share of global electricity generation alongside solar PV. Wind energy's near-zero greenhouse gas emissions and high energy return on energy invested (EROEI) make it an essential solution for reducing emissions.\nAdditionally, wind power supports job creation, particularly in China and Europe, with 1.4 million jobs in 2022. Wind turbines have an operational lifespan of 20 years, running nearly emissions-free after offsetting construction emissions within 3-6 months."

This ambitious project aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while tapping into the country's substantial wind energy potential, estimated at 929 billion kWh annually, equivalent to 154 GW of installed capacity. By the time the project concluded in 2011, it had laid critical groundwork for wind energy development, addressing systemic barriers and fostering a more favorable environment for renewable energy investment.\nAt the outset, the project faced significant obstacles. Awareness of wind energy\u2019s potential was minimal, and technical capacity within the country was underdeveloped. There were no operational wind farms to provide a proof of concept, and financial barriers loomed large, including low electricity tariffs, high commercial risks, and challenges in securing both domestic and foreign investment. Institutional barriers further hindered progress, with an absence of dedicated policies, regulatory frameworks, and centralized mechanisms to promote and manage wind energy projects."

While feed-in tariffs were once a key tool for investment certainty, many markets are now shifting toward auction-based systems or moving away from subsidies altogether as renewable energy becomes increasingly cost-competitive.\nThe initiative also fostered capacity-building through training programs, enabling local professionals to acquire expertise in wind energy technologies, resource assessment, and project planning. Over 100 professionals were trained, and specialized software tools were introduced to streamline project development processes.\r\nSignificant progress was also made in engaging stakeholders, from government agencies to private investors. The establishment of partnerships with international and national organizations laid the foundation for ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Hydropower is highly valuable for grid stability, providing fast-response generation and supporting frequency stability. However, its potential is influenced by climate-related changes in rainfall and ecosystems, with droughts posing a challenge. \n\nHydropower offers substantial carbon emissions reductions, saving up to 4 billion tonnes of CO2 annually compared to coal. It accounts for about 9% of global CO2 emissions reduction. In the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario, hydropower continues to grow at an average rate of 4% annually. There remains considerable untapped potential for hydropower development. Global technical potential is estimated at 14,576 TWh/year, over four times current generation levels.

                "text": "Geothermal energy provides reliable, base-load power and heating/cooling from a widely available resource. It offers sustainable production and generates cost-effective, dispatchable power, unaffected by climate conditions. Geothermal energy has lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional base-load thermal generation. In off-peak periods, it can also help recharge battery-powered vehicles, further reducing CO2 emissions. \n\nGeothermal energy can become a key part of future electricity and heating systems, offering a clean and reliable energy source. Right now, geothermal meets less than 1% of global energy demand, and its use is mostly in countries with easily accessible, high-quality resources like the United States, Iceland, Indonesia, T\u00fcrkiye, Kenya, and Italy."

                "text": "Geothermal energy has the potential to significantly contribute to global electricity demand by 2050. Advancements in technology and reductions in project costs could enable the deployment of up to 800 gigawatts (GW) of geothermal capacity worldwide, generating nearly 6,000 terawatt-hours annually\u2014equivalent to the current combined electricity consumption of the United States and India.\u200b\n\nA notable advantage of geothermal power is its ability to provide continuous, baseload electricity. Geothermal plants can operate at full capacity 24/7, offering a reliable energy source. In 2023, global geothermal capacity had a utilization rate exceeding 75%, significantly higher than wind power's less than 30% and solar photovoltaic's (PV) less than 15%. Additionally, geothermal plants can operate flexibly, aiding in grid stabilization and complementing intermittent renewable sources like solar PV and wind.\u200b\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that, with appropriate support, costs for next-generation geothermal technologies could decrease by 80% by 2035. At this cost level, geothermal plants could produce electricity at approximately $50 per megawatt-hour (MWh), positioning them among the most affordable dispatchable low-emission electricity sources, comparable to or cheaper than hydro, nuclear, and bioenergy. Furthermore, geothermal energy would be highly competitive with solar and wind power when paired with battery storage."

Blue hydrogen, made from natural gas through methods like steam methane reforming and autothermal reforming, produces CO2 but can capture and store it. Green hydrogen, produced through electrolysis using renewable electricity, has no harmful by-products. \n\nHydrogen plays a fundamental role in mitigating sectors that have proven hard to abate. Global hydrogen demand grew by 3% in 2022 to 95 million tonnes.  There are mainly heavy industry, shipping, long-distance land transport, and aviation. Implementing clean hydrogen provides relatively low technical challenges in the refining and fertilizer sectors, as it can be a like-for-like substitution for others.  More than 393 agreements were made related to hydrogen in 2022."
