                "text": "Transport relies heavily on internal combustion engines (ICE) powered by fossil fuels. It accounts for over one-third of CO2 emissions from end-use sectors. In 2022, passenger and cargo activity rebounded after the Covid-19 pandemic. This led to a 3% rise in transport CO2 emissions compared to 2021. From 1990 to 2022, transport emissions grew at an average annual rate of 1.7%, the same as industry. To align with the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 Scenario, transport emissions must decrease by more than 3% annually until 2030.\u00a0\u00a0\nAchieving this requires swift road vehicle electrification, improved energy efficiency, scaled-up low-emissions fuels in maritime and aviation, and policies that promote shifts to less carbon-intensive transport modes. Here, we will focus on road transport. Electrification is the most promising path to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency in road transport."

However, more importantly, their significance extends beyond decarbonization, aligning with broader developmental objectives. Particularly, the opportunity lies in electrifying micro-mobility, first and last-mile transport, and public transport systems, thereby contributing to a more equitable and socially just access to services and opportunities within these regions. E-mobility also offers a promising pathway to improved health outcomes by reducing air pollution, a significant concern in low- and middle-income countries, where 89% of the 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide occur due to pollution.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMoreover, a compelling case for EVs can be made in countries that have a transport culture that is supported by sizeable oil importers. For instance, in Small Island Developing States heavily reliant on fossil fuels, e-mobility can reduce fossil fuel dependence and enhance energy security, addressing the volatility of gas and oil prices that disproportionately affect people."

The latter may comprise tax benefits, rebates, purchase support and subsidized charging at public stations. Preferential electricity rates, such as those outlined in Rwanda's e-mobility policy, could incentivize people to charge vehicles during off-peak hours, reducing grid strain and increasing the likelihood of EV adoption amid volatile fuel prices.\u00a0\u00a0\nExpanding investment in electric public transport is essential, particularly in low-income countries, to improve access and affordability. Blended finance models could help de-risk investments and expand financing options.

Demand for lithium-ion batteries, the predominant choice for EVs, has spiked 65%, from around 330 GWh in 2021 to 550 GWh in 2022 (Figure 4). As a result, demand for critical minerals has also skyrocketed. In 2022, EV batteries drove approximately 60% of global demand for lithium, 30% for cobalt and 10% for nickel. Demand for critical minerals is projected to increase by three and half times by 2030, reaching over 30 million tonnes.\u00a0\nIncreased extraction of critical minerals in developing countries creates challenges and opportunities. Africa, for example, holds over 50% of global reserves and production of cobalt and manganese. Despite the vital role of critical minerals in government revenues, however, they are predominantly exported in raw forms, financially benefiting only a fraction of society. Maximizing development gains requires value addition, including through developing local capacities for refining and processing. Zimbabwe's Mines to Energy Park stands out as a prime example, positioning the country as a producer of lithium-ion batteries and allowing it to capitalize on its mineral reserves."

Ultimately, the goal must be to create sustainable urban mobility systems centred around public transport. This approach could help bridge the global divide in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11, particularly its target to provide sustainable transportation for all. Electrification, active mobility, micro-mobility solutions, green fleets and mobility-as-a-service \u2013 these are exciting starting points for a transformational\u00a0shift in energy and transport, one\u00a0that would unlock broad development benefits for people around the world."
