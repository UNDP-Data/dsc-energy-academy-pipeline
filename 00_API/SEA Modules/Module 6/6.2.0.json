              "text": "This chapter examines the role of sustainable energy in climate mitigation, focusing on the environmental, economic, and health benefits of renewable energy technologies. It highlights the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewables to meet global climate goals, particularly the Paris Agreement’s target of limiting global temperature rise to below 2°C. In this chapter, we will explore the climate benefits of renewable energy, emphasizing its near-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil fuels. Additionally, we will understand the lifecycle emissions across energy sources, showing that renewables like wind and solar produce significantly lower emissions than coal and natural gas. The chapter also explores the economic and health benefits of renewable energy, including reduced air pollution and its associated health risks, as well as the social cost of carbon savings."

              "text": "Water use and quality are also addressed, with renewable energy technologies shown to consume far less water than fossil fuel power plants, which are major contributors to freshwater withdrawals and water pollution. The chapter highlights the potential for renewables to improve water quality by reducing harmful discharges into water bodies. The chapter then delves into key renewable energy technologies—solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and hydrogen—that are driving the global energy transition. Each technology is examined in terms of its current capacity, growth potential, and role in reducing emissions. The chapter also discusses the challenges associated with implementing these technologies, such as grid integration, high initial costs, and the need for supportive policies and infrastructure. By integrating environmental, economic, and social considerations, the chapter provides a framework for understanding the benefits and challenges of renewable energy technologies in climate mitigation. It underscores the importance of continued innovation, policy support, and investment to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy future."
