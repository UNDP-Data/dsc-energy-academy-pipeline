Climate change can lead to facility damage, for example to coal, natural gas, and nuclear thermal power plants, which can suffer damage from extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and heatwaves. Climate events can also impact thermal power plantsâ€™ typical operation through variations in local cooling water availability, hydraulic head intake level, and temperature. Similarly, solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric dams are vulnerable to extreme weather events and environmental changes, leading to physical damage and reduced energy production. Due to climate change, some transmission and distribution networks can be damaged, ie. lines, substations, transformers, while grid infrastructure are also susceptible to damage from extreme weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, ice storms, and wildfires. One can also note that coastal and low-lying areas with energy infrastructure are at risk from sea-level rise, storm surges, and increased precipitation, leading to flooding and infrastructure damage. To add to this, energy storage facilities such as battery systems are vulnerable to extreme temperatures, flooding, and other climate-related hazards, leading to reduced efficiency, capacity loss, and operational challenges.",

The following sections explore key components of vulnerability assessment, including risk mapping and the identification of physical and operational vulnerabilities. The vulnerability assessment focuses primarily on physical and operational risks, which are foundational to understanding infrastructure resilience. However, financial vulnerability is also a crucial aspect, particularly in the context of cost-benefit analysis (CBA).

It should also take into account reduced cooling periods due to higher average temperatures as well as changes in usage patterns. It's also important to consider that the impacts of climate change on energy systems can be amplified by systemic factors such as energy system interdependencies, water scarcity, and increased electricity demand. These broader considerations play into vulnerability evaluations as they affect the overall robustness and reliability of the energy supply chain."

Integrating DERs requires not only technology but also regulatory frameworks, market mechanisms, and incentives that support their adoption and operation. Effective integration into the existing grid infrastructure is key, including the need for smart grid technologies that can manage the two-way flow of electricity and information.
