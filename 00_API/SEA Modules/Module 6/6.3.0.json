              "text": "This chapter examines the role of sustainable energy in climate adaptation, emphasizing how renewable energy, energy efficiency, and decentralized infrastructure contribute to building resilience against climate risks. It highlights the vulnerabilities of energy systems to extreme weather events, including physical damage and efficiency reductions, and explores strategies for enhancing their adaptability. Key considerations include the integration of distributed energy resources, smart grid technologies, and infrastructure reinforcement to improve system reliability. The chapter also discusses the role of renewable energy in supporting climate adaptation efforts, such as improving food security, water management, and emergency response through decentralized energy solutions. Additionally, it underscores the importance of risk assessments, policy frameworks, and financing mechanisms to support climate-resilient energy planning. Recognizing that climate risks disproportionately affect marginalized communities, the chapter emphasizes inclusive approaches that integrate local knowledge and participatory decision-making to ensure equitable adaptation strategies."
