Comparing per capita energy consumption highlights the stark differences between regions and countries (see Figure 4). For example, the average American uses 12 times more energy than the average Indian, consuming in one month what an Indian consumes in a year. The contrast is even starker between North America and Africa, where the average North American consumes more than 50 times the energy of the average African. Similarly, the average Briton uses twice as much energy as the average Brazilian."
