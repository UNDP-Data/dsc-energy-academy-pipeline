It emphasizes the role of data in informing evidence-based decision-making, supporting energy policy formulation, and tracking progress toward sustainable energy goals. The module also explores the challenges associated with data quality and availability, as well as the ethical considerations related to data collection and sharing. Participants will learn about common PM&E frameworks and key performance indicators (KPIs) used in the energy sector, as well as the significance of standardized reporting frameworks in measuring and reporting on progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7). The module aims to equip UNDP Country Offices and policymakers with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively collect, analyse, and utilize energy data for driving positive change. </h4><h6>MODULE 10</h6>",

Identifying the gap between the existing situation and the ideal vision, which is an essential stage in policymaking, requires data. For instance, data is necessary for providing information on current conditions, revealing areas for improvement, and offering actionable insights. Without a strong rationale backed up by data, the policy can potentially be inaccurately implemented and furthermore, impact people negatively. Therefore, the role of data in policy making in the energy sector is undoubtedly imperative. \n\nData can help improve transparency in the energy sector. Transparency can improve governance in the energy sector by showing the public live data and holding the stakeholders accountable. For example, providing information on energy supply and demand can give room for public organizations, such as non-governmental organizations, research centres, or any interested institutions, to identify the current energy system issues not covered by the government’s perspective and give recommendations on those issues. \n </h4><h6>Solar Power grid Integration with Data</h6><h1>UNDP defines data-driven decision-making as “the process of using data to inform your decision-making process and validate a course of action before committing to it”.\n\n  </h1><h6>Key areas of decision-making where data can make a difference</h6>",

Data can help build a complete picture of the issue and identify the root cause. It can help spot the gaps and potential areas that could be improved. Also, data can provide evidence of successful policies in other places, so policymakers can have a benchmark they can observe, modify, and apply in the context of the scope under their authority. Data can support the model and analyse different strategies by quantifying the costs, risks, and benefits. This analysis is necessary to ensure the policy options are the least cost and the most impactful. Data can guide policymakers in picking the fittest policy by quantifying the costs and benefits. It can also identify the risks that might appear so policymakers can minimize those risks by formulating and applying some strategies based on existing data indicators. \n \nIn the second stage, monitoring, policymakers can track the progress of their goals and objectives from data. Through data analysis, they can identify trends and patterns that can strengthen or weaken the policy for achieving goals. \n\nStakeholders can also evaluate the effectiveness of the policy implementation by comparing the actual and expected outcomes. In addition to that, data can also inform the public about the progress of such policy implementation, so the public can actively participate in monitoring the progress and giving feedback to policymakers. Ultimately, data can establish a mechanism for development in the energy sector that can improve the performance of policies through monitoring systems. \n \nIn the evaluation stage, data is crucial as it enables evidence-based assessment that is objective, factual, and credible. Data provides concrete evidence to be assessed independently of subjective biases or opinions. This facilitates policymakers to come to conclusions whether the desired outcomes are being achieved objectively. Policymakers can evaluate which aspects of policy can be improved using data. Data-driven evaluations promote learning and continuous improvement in many areas in energy sectors. </h4><h6>Results-based management life-cycle approach</h6>",
