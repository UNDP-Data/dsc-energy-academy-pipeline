Identifying the gap between the existing situation and the ideal vision (whether current or future), which is an essential stage in policy making, requires data. For instance, data are necessary for providing information on current conditions, revealing areas for improvement, and offering actionable insights. Without a strong rationale backed up by data, the policy can be implemented incorrectly, negatively impacting people. The role of data in policy making in the energy sector is imperative. This lesson breaks down the key qualities of energy data—like accuracy, reliability, and timeliness—and why they matter for making better decisions. It also looks at how data fits into the policy-making process, from spotting problems and setting goals to tracking progress and checking results. With practical examples and case studies, we’ll see how data can help shape energy policies that work for everyone."

              "text": "Data play a crucial role in enhancing governmental transparency and fostering public engagement in energy governance. By enabling central governments (e.g., Ministries of Energy), grid operators, energy distribution companies, and generation companies to share real-time information—such as energy supply, demand, and infrastructure performance—governments can empower a wide range of stakeholders, including NGOs, research institutions, and local communities, to identify overlooked challenges in the energy system and co-create actionable recommendations. This collaborative approach strengthens accountability, bridges gaps between policymakers and frontline actors, and broadens the perspectives included in decision-making. Historical trends in energy production, consumption, trade, and distribution provide a robust foundation for strategic planning. Analyzing these patterns helps decision-makers anticipate future challenges and opportunities while developing models to simulate various scenarios. These simulations can incorporate factors such as technological advances, policy shifts, changes in consumer behavior, and the impact of natural or man-made disasters, offering valuable insights into potential outcomes and supporting evidence-based strategies. Additionally, data are essential for evaluating the impact of energy policies and tracking progress toward key goals. By using data-driven modeling, decision-makers can assess the potential effects of policy options before implementation, reducing risks and improving outcomes. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of energy-related initiatives ensure that policies remain effective over time, allowing for necessary adjustments and keeping progress aligned with long-term objectives."

Surviving vegetation is under water stress and can burn easily, one of the most visible consequences being the large and tragic fires of 2014, 2017, 2023, and 2024[1]. Chile is committed to fighting against climate change, so it set in 2022 the goal for the country to be carbon neutral and resilient to the effects of climate change by 2050 (Climate Change Framework Law 21.455). To meet this goal, the focus on the energy sector is necessary as it is estimated to be responsible for 78% of the country's GHG emissions. Carbon neutrality is expected to be achieved by establishing mitigation measures in the energy sector and reinforcing the conservation of CO2 capture capacity by the forestry sector [2]."

The analysis was based on the \"Moderate Pathway to Carbon Neutrality\" scenario proposed on this evaluation. The primary focus was on the mitigation measures to reduce emissions in the energy sector to a level where total GHG emissions are equal or lower than the CO2 capture capacity of the national forests. This encompasses proposed measures for the forestry sector and land-use changes by 2050. The IFF study analyzed 45 GHG mitigation measures across six sectors: transport, housing, public, commercial, mining-industry and electricity. Households and businesses are the ones that will need to change their investment flows the most. The government will need to invest directly in initiatives such as constructing bike lanes, retrofitting housing, and implementing energy efficiency programs, or to subsidize energy shifting programs to install solar energy systems such as “Solar House”. Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are expected to decrease, resulting in savings. Households will benefit the most from these savings thanks to the reforms in the transport and housing sectors. Business will also benefit from the decrease in O&M but need to invest more first. Overall, the mitigation measures will improve the Chilean quality of life and health and could save up to $267,249 million from 2021 to 2050, mainly benefiting the transportation and residential sectors while supporting energy projects."

Transportation, residential, and public sector initiatives receive most of the state funding, aiming to reduce costs and encourage similar practices. However, financing is not the only barrier to reach carbon neutrality by 2050; social and user perception of environmental benefits are also hindrances. The IFF methodology has proven key in identifying capital flows and responsible entities, aiding in anticipating peak capital requirements. Chile’s case highlights the importance of aligning financial, social, and environmental dimensions in energy policy. It also underscores the need for comprehensive planning that includes sectors like forestry, which are vital for CO2 capture but vulnerable to climate impacts. By prioritizing robust data collection and analysis, Chile exemplifies how governments can develop actionable strategies to achieve ambitious sustainability goals."
