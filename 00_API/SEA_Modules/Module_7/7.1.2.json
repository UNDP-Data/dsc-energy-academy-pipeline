To be just and sustainable, it must involve achieving both universal access to modern energy services and moving towards clean energy supplies. All five of the other signature solutions, on poverty, governance, resilience, the environment, and gender equality, have close ties to energy. Working with partners to support their efforts on delivering energy access and scale up the UNDP’s impact is essential to achieve the energy moonshot. UNDP’s comparative advantage lies in its ability to leverage its integrator mandate and maximize partnerships across the UN and other partners and can offer an integral development focus combining multiple development benefits that are enabled by clean energy; and reaching those “left behind” and hard-to-reach areas. Delivering independent technical advice using our in-country presence and knowledge of the local context and stakeholders will address unmet demand. The UNDP energy portfolio encompasses a variety of interventions dedicated to supporting numerous energy-related activities with a focus on development. These interventions directly contribute to promoting energy access and fostering a just energy transition through investments in clean energy, the utilization of renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, clean cooking solutions, and showcasing local initiatives aimed at reducing fossil fuel dependence in both household and commercial activities. The UNDP energy portfolio extends its reach to support e-mobility initiatives, contributing to a comprehensive and sustainable approach to energy development."

This is the first time that we have a detailed mapping on Vertical and Non-Vertical Fund projects. A methodology has been developed to convert project outputs into a quantification of indirect and direct beneficiaries. The portfolio of project outputs has been collated from inputs from the 130 UNDP Country Offices (COs), and an effort is underway to clean up this data to prepare it for conversion based on the proposed methodology. This operation is essential to: monitor the achievement of UNDP energy moonshot counting the number of beneficiaries, direct and indirect, but also to support UNDP Country Offices (COs) and UNDP as whole to have access to global data in the field of energy for development. link the work on UNDP with partners for a collective effort to achieve the energy moonshot. align the energy moonshot with the other moonshot and identify areas of connection to work together with an integrated approach."

This framework enables a nuanced understanding of energy services, helping policymakers and practitioners to address barriers that perpetuate exclusion and inequality. Developed by the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program in 2015, the MTF moves beyond binary classifications. It introduces a system of tiers that assess access across multiple dimensions, such as capacity, reliability, affordability, quality, formality, and health and safety. This approach provides a detailed portrait of energy access, revealing the multifaceted challenges faced by communities at various stages of energy service provision. For instance, electricity access becomes more than the presence of infrastructure; it includes factors like service reliability and affordability, which often dictate whether energy is genuinely accessible. Similarly, access to modern cooking solutions is evaluated through attributes like fuel availability, stove efficiency, and safety, shedding light on barriers that hinder widespread adoption."

              "text": "Effective use of the MTF hinges on inclusive data collection. Data must reflect the diverse realities of marginalized groups—rural households, indigenous communities, and informal settlements—whose energy challenges often remain invisible in traditional surveys. Combining quantitative measures with qualitative insights allows for a richer understanding of energy access, making it possible to address structural inequities more effectively. By prioritizing inclusivity, data collection efforts can move beyond technical measurements to reflect broader socio-economic and cultural dimensions of energy access. This approach ensures that policies and programs are informed by the perspectives of those most impacted by energy transitions. The MTF is more than a measurement tool; it is an instrument for reshaping how energy planning is conducted. It highlights overlooked dimensions of energy systems, prompting governments and organizations to rethink priorities. For instance, insights from the MTF might redirect resources from infrastructure expansion to affordability mechanisms, reliability improvements, or targeted subsidies for clean cooking solutions. This framework also facilitates cross-sectoral collaboration by linking energy access to health, education, and economic development. Its multidimensional perspective underscores the interconnected nature of energy access and broader development outcomes, fostering more integrated and effective strategies."

              "text": "Effective transparency in reporting delivers numerous benefits. First, it builds trust by mitigating suspicions of bias or manipulation and demonstrating the integrity of the data. Comprehensive and reproducible reporting practices ensure that stakeholders can verify findings and use the data confidently. Without such transparency, stakeholders may question the objectivity of the data, potentially undermining trust and engagement (Junne et al., 2019). Second, transparent reporting enables peer-to-peer learning and benchmarking, helping organizations and governments compare their energy frameworks against regional or global counterparts. It serves as a valuable resource for investors and developers, providing the data needed to perform due diligence and attract capital. Transparent practices also create opportunities to exchange lessons and insights across different regions facing similar challenges, enhancing collective problem-solving (Banarjee, 2017). Finally, transparency underpins evidence-based policymaking. By providing clear and traceable data, it supports the development and evaluation of regulations and policies aimed at advancing sustainable energy. A lack of transparent reporting can erode confidence in the policy environment, making it difficult to assess progress or adapt strategies effectively. To strengthen the role of transparency and accountability in energy data reporting, stakeholders must prioritize practices that emphasize reproducibility, inclusivity, and clarity, ensuring that data serves as a reliable tool for driving progress in the energy transition."

In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines PII as information that can uniquely identify an individual, such as names, Social Security numbers, or biometric records. However, the U.S. lacks a comprehensive, unified definition of PII, leading to varied interpretations across jurisdictions and states. In contrast, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes a broader approach, defining personal data as \"any information which is related to an identified or identifiable natural person.\" This includes direct identifiers like names as well as quasi-identifiers such as location data or online behavior. Despite these frameworks, public trust is often eroded by inconsistent enforcement, opaque data practices, and high-profile breaches. For example, energy usage data—when aggregated with other datasets—can inadvertently reveal sensitive household behaviors, such as occupancy patterns or appliance usage. Without strict anonymization protocols, informed consent, and transparent governance, communities may resist sharing data, undermining policy efforts."

Energy data, whether gathered through surveys or administrative records, should be collected voluntarily and only for its intended purpose. Ethical practices require minimizing harm to communities, avoiding biases in data design, and ensuring informed consent. However, ethical gaps persist. Data divides are widening as wealthier nations and institutions prioritize insights that align with their financial or geopolitical interests. Some intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) restrict data reporting to member states or funders, excluding low-income countries that lack resources to commission targeted analyses. For instance, energy access datasets in sub-Saharan Africa often rely on outdated or incomplete surveys due to funding constraints, while high-income countries benefit from real-time smart meter data. This inequity perpetuates systemic biases, slowing progress toward SDG7 (universal energy access) and deepening global disparities."

Such efforts demonstrate how institutions can rebuild trust through accountability. Ultimately, privacy and ethical practices are essential to maintain public trust, support equitable policy-making, and harness data for societal benefit.
