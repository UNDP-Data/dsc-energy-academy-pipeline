The project focuses on three pillars: servitization, digitalization, and capacity-building [3]. The primary objectives of ‘Your VCCA’ Initiative are to reduce food losses and improve food security by providing smallholder farmers access to affordable, efficient, and clean cold storage solutions; leverage solar energy for sustainable post-harvest cooling; and empower smallholder farmers, especially women, by providing digital tools and training to enhance their decision-making and management capabilities. The Your VCCA Initiative is centered on providing solar-powered cold rooms through a \"Cooling as a Service\" (CaaS) model, which enables smallholders to gain access to cooling without upfront costs (see Figure 1) [4]. Digitalization is a key catalyst in the success of Your VCCA. It involves a mobile application based on data science that uses machine learning and physics-based food modeling, which helps smallholder farmers access sustainable cooling facilities through servitization. The program utilizes \"Coldtivate\", an application, to streamline inventory management and operations and build trust among farmers in post-harvest cooling [5]. Real-time temperature sensor data, incorporated into Coldtivate, estimates the remaining storage life of each crate, enabling farmers to preserve crop quality effectively. The App also offers market price forecasts, enabling farmers to make informed selling choices. Users without smartphones receive SMS notifications about their stored crops' status, underscoring the inclusion and accessibility of the initiative."

In addition to building the cold room in a central public space, easy and safe for women to visit, Koel Fresh, a VCCA partner in India, onboarded members of the Maa Tarini Women’s Self-Help Group (SHG) to increase the room’s cultural accessibility [3]. Engaging the self-help group (SHG) aimed to develop local women's skills in managing the cold room using digital tools and to empower female farmers to use the facilities without being hindered by gender and power dynamics. The pilot project in Bihar and Himachal Pradesh (2021-2022) demonstrated the economic viability of the CaaS business model and the value-add of the VCCA app. Preliminary data from frequent cold room users (34 women and 14 men) indicate a reduction in crop spoilage from 17% to 4%. Farmers' incomes increased by 29.6%, with female users reporting a 34.3% increase compared to 18.8% reported by male users [3]. The Your VCCA Initiative sets a global example for agro-based economies. Its replicability is evident in its potential to be adapted in other regions facing similar challenges. Key factors for replicability include the availability of solar energy, the adoption of digital tools, and community engagement. Moreover, it shows how engaging local women in managing operations and finances using digital tools can enhance cultural accessibility and overcoming gender-related barriers for female farmers in utilizing the resources."

The researchers developed machine learning models to classify the location of erosion and predict its severity, achieving high accuracy. This innovative approach, enhanced by AutoML—which automates the process of selecting optimal models and tuning hyperparameters— provides a comprehensive method for predictive maintenance, minimizing downtime, and enhancing wind turbine efficiency. Muxica et al. (2024) applied A.I. in remote sensing within the energy sector by designing and implementing an autonomous sensor system for vibration measurement in low-capacity wind turbines. This system, deployed on wind turbines operating under harsh weather conditions, uses A.I. to process data collected from triaxial accelerometers attached to the blades. The A.I. processes enable real-time monitoring and evaluation of the dynamic characteristics of wind turbine blades, facilitating early damage detection and maintenance. By integrating A.I. with remote sensing technologies, the system ensures reliable and efficient wind turbine operation, reducing maintenance costs and enhancing the overall reliability of wind energy generation.

              "text": "To help solve these issues, UNDP implemented a project to eradicate poverty and social inequality, but it was mainly challenged by the unavailability of robust data to make strategies and high-level decisions. Therefore, Thinking Machines helped UNDP and Zero Extreme Poverty PH 2030 – a Philippine coalition of NGOs, to implement a project of Understanding Poverty in the Philippines with Artificial Intelligence. This project aims to use machine learning and satellite imagery to map poverty in the Philippines. Specifically, the main goal is to overcome the challenges of collecting reliable socioeconomic data that is relatively time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. The project’s main objectives include using transfer learning and satellite imagery to map poverty in the country, developing a preliminary poverty prediction model for the Philippines, and overcoming the limitations of traditional on-ground surveys by leveraging machine learning and geospatial information. The project was first implemented by utilizing the 2017 National Demographic and Health Survey data. The datasets include the country’s household wealth scores based on attributes such as roof material, appliance ownership, and more importantly, access to water and electricity. Furthermore, the data collected were then extracted by applying transfer learning to map poverty using nighttime lights as a proxy for economic development. Higher levels of GDP are correlated with greater electricity use, access, reliability, and affordability , therefore, those regions with more nighttime lights could be perceived to be more developed economically. With this combination of machine learning and geospatial data, they were able to provide more accurate and detailed poverty estimates across the country."

The results also showed better comparison of the average actual wealth index across the Philippines. With this approach, this kind of project can be rolled out to other geographies considering its efficiency in providing results at a lower cost, compared to the conventional randomized surveys. Furthermore, this kind of project can also help developing countries to improve their energy access, leading to enhanced economic development."

In the energy sector, where data have an important role in justifying and rationalizing decision making, an effective visualization can enhance clarity and comprehensibility, whereas an ineffective visualization can cause confusion and loss of focus. There isn’t a global standardized framework on data visualization, however there is guidance on best principles, which come from years of research and experimentation in the design and media industries. Guidance on best practice can be found in the book Visualizing Data and in the webpage Material Design. Both references explain the correct use of graphs, the use of annotations and elements of editorial design."
