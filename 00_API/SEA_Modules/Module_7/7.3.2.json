Within this system, renewable energy sources (RES) play a pivotal role, offering sustainable energy options like solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. In contrast, fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, constitute non-renewable energy sources derived from ancient organic matter. Likewise, nuclear energy is currently produced from uranium and plutonium, and all nuclear fuels are finite resources. The energy mix refers to the combination of different energy sources used to meet energy demand in a specific region or country. However, concerns about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions prompt the adoption of measures, such as carbon taxes, aimed at reducing GHG emissions and encouraging cleaner energy sources. Achieving net-zero emissions, i.e., balancing emitted and removed GHGs, is a key objective. The capacity factor, defined as the actual energy production of an energy generation unit (for example, a wind turbine or a solar plant) relative to maximum energy produced if unit had been operating at full capacity for the same period of time., Capacity factor is a measure of operational efficiency."

Crucial data are collected from various energy applications and, through data analytics, embedded with actionable intelligence that informs strategies for the evolving sustainable energy landscape. This further equips policymakers, governments, and supporting organizations with informed, intelligent insights that lead to effective collaborative strategies for creating enabling environments for sustainable energy adoption. This functionality hinges on the accessibility of high-quality data for targeted energy modelling interventions that inform energy development strategies, drive innovation, and monitor development progress."

Unlike predictive or optimization models, descriptive models focus on accurately describing existing conditions rather than forecasting future scenarios or optimizing resource allocation. Descriptive models rely heavily on empirical data to reflect the actual performance and characteristics of energy systems. They use historical data on energy production, consumption, prices, and other relevant parameters. They are used for benchmarking current performance, identifying trends, and understanding historical energy system dynamics. LEAP is a descriptive model widely used for energy policy analysis and climate change mitigation assessment. It is a flexible, data-driven model that can represent energy systems at various levels of detail used by governments, NGOs, and research institutions to understand current energy systems and evaluate the impacts of different energy policies."

These models use mathematical optimization techniques to determine the best possible solutions under given constraints.

Predictive models use statistical methods and algorithms to estimate future energy demand, supply, prices, and other relevant parameters. These models evaluate different scenarios to understand how changes in variables such as economic growth, population, technology adoption, and policy measures will impact future energy systems. EnergyPLAN is a tool for advanced energy system analysis that includes the ability to simulate and predict future energy demand and supply under various scenarios, mainly used for national and regional energy planning, including the integration of renewable energy sources. Predictive energy models are essential tools for anticipating future energy system dynamics. By providing insights into potential future states and identifying risks and opportunities, these models support informed decision-making and strategic planning in the energy sector."

Energy models are used to analyze historical consumption patterns, demographic trends, weather data, and economic indicators to develop accurate forecasts of electricity load and implement strategies for demand-side management. Short-term load forecasting involves predicting electricity demand over hours, days, or weeks ahead. Energy models use statistical techniques, time series analysis, and machine learning algorithms to analyze historical load data and incorporate factors such as weather conditions, day of the week, and holidays."

By simulating different scenarios and assessing the impacts of renewable energy deployment, energy models help policymakers, grid operators, and utilities design resilient and efficient energy systems that incorporate a higher share of intermittent generation, usually from renewable sources. Energy models assist in planning the optimal mix and capacity of renewable energy technologies (e.g., solar photovoltaic, wind turbines) to meet future electricity demand while considering factors such as resource availability, technology costs, and grid constraints. Models analyze the spatial distribution of renewable resources and their temporal variability to identify suitable locations for renewable energy projects and optimize their operation and integration into the grid. Energy models assess the compatibility of renewable energy projects with existing grid infrastructure and evaluate the need for grid upgrades, reinforcements, and flexibility measures to accommodate variable and intermittent generation."

It is a country that had an electricity access rate of 38 % as of 2019 and the electricity mix is largely dominated by hydropower generation. Tanzania aims to achieve 75 % electricity access by 2025 through the expansion of the national grid or use of mini-grid1. To assess the possibility of achieving universal access and at the same time achieving a clean electricity generation mix, two modelling tools were used; Python for Power System Analysis (PyPSA) and Geographical Information System tool. The study assessed two scenarios: the Power System Masterplan (PSMP) Scenario and the Clean Energy Transition Tanzania (CETT) Scenario. The first scenario modeled generation expansion based on the least-cost generation expansion approach, where all available technologies were evaluated and selected based on their operational costs to meet demand. This scenario did not consider GHG emissions or universal access to electricity. It was found that under this scenario, emissions continued to rise until 2050, and some communities remained without power. This indicates that focusing solely on the cost of the power system leads to unsustainable electricity development, as it neglects environmental impacts and electricity access rates."

This scenario incorporated environmental, economic, and social aspects, aiming to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7. However, the results revealed that the investment required to achieve these goals is enormous, making public funds alone insufficient to build a sustainable power system of this magnitude. The study highlighted that private investors and development agencies are crucial for clean energy development. It also identified barriers to universal access to electricity and low-carbon electricity sectors that could hinder these two players in clean energy development. To encourage investment in the clean energy industry, the study recommends that the government create an enabling environment by allowing market forces to determine electricity prices, fostering the development of strong and independent institutions, and using auction systems for investments in the renewable energy sector. The tools used in the study make it replicable, but the challenge lies in understanding the type of data solicited from engaged stakeholders and how it was implemented."
