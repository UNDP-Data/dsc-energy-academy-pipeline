This disparity stems from systemic gender discrimination and societal expectations linked to traditional gender roles. The UNFCCC's case studies reveal a complex interaction of social factors that places women and marginalized groups at heightened risk of experiencing prolonged adverse effects of climate change. The report underscores that the differentiated impacts of climate change are shaped by the intersection of social factors such as urban or rural residence, sexual orientation, educational attainment, income level, gender, ethnicity, age, social class, and disability."

Addressing this gap is critical to understanding the barriers these populations face, identifying effective solutions to improve their lives, and removing obstacles to their full development in an increasingly complex world. The lack of data not only obscures these disparities but can also perpetuate them (DataGénero, 2024) Two key challenges hinder progress in gender data: first, a significant lack of disaggregated and relevant information; second, the data that does exist is often inaccessible, outdated, or fails to capture intersectional realities. These gaps make it difficult to assess how energy policies and projects affect different populations, reinforcing existing inequities. Energy insecurity and environmental degradation disproportionately affect women and marginalized groups, exacerbating vulnerabilities linked to resource scarcity and climate change. Women, for example, are often responsible for energy-intensive household tasks and rely on natural resources for their livelihoods. Yet, without adequate gender-sensitive data, policies fail to address these disparities, limiting progress toward a just and equitable energy transition."

SDG7 is among the six Sustainable Development Goals that lack gender-specific indicators, reflecting a broader data gap that limits our ability to identify and address the unique barriers women face in accessing, using, and benefiting from energy systems (SE4all, 2024). This absence of critical data not only impedes women’s full participation in the energy transition and their potential as agents of change, but it also hinders the formulation of targeted policies, exacerbates energy poverty among women, and undermines efforts to achieve sustainable economic growth. Without comprehensive, gender-sensitive data, stakeholders struggle to design interventions that promote energy equity, reduce risks associated with inadequate access, and leverage the full economic and social benefits of a truly inclusive energy system. Without robust data on women’s roles, experiences, and participation in the energy sector, policymakers face challenges in designing inclusive interventions and policies. This gap often results in energy planning and policies that are gender-blind, with some regulations and subsidies inadvertently perpetuating gender inequalities."

However, it's important to recognize that the interpretation and classification of bodies, and thus the construction of sexual difference, are shaped by socio-historical processes. As shown by Lacquer in his influential work \"Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud\" , these processes play a significant role in shaping societal perceptions of sex (Laqueur, 1992) It is worth noting that sex is often assigned at birth based solely on external characteristics, leading to challenges for intersex individuals who may not fit traditional binary categorizations. Intersex people frequently lack legal recognition due to their bodies being perceived as different. This lack of recognition can contribute to stigmatization and result in multiple human rights violations, including forced and coerced medical interventions."

As Judith Butler elaborates in her seminal work, gender is not an inherent trait but rather a performative act, continuously constructed and reinforced through repeated actions and interactions within social contexts. These expectations and norms vary across cultures and societies, subject to continual negotiation and transformation over time. Different societies hold diverse notions of masculinity and femininity, and many recognize the existence of multiple genders beyond the binary. Therefore, gender is not fixed or static but rather fluid and dynamic, reflecting the complex interplay of social, cultural, and historical influences."

Biological sex, as traditionally understood, does not account for the socially constructed and dynamic nature of gender, which shapes power dynamics, access to resources, and energy-related behaviors. By relying solely on sex-disaggregated data, we risk oversimplifying complex gender dynamics and potentially overlooking critical barriers and opportunities within the energy transition. While sex-disaggregated data is a critical starting point, it is only the first step in fostering a gender-equitable approach to energy policy and planning."

It is imperative to ensure that the language is accessible to women, that the times and locations of the consultations take into account women's mobility (locations closer to their households) and care roles (including with identification of times that are appropriate for women and providing care options for their family members, for example). Open discussions involving both men and women may not be adequate to facilitate women’s participation; specific measures may be needed to overcome social prohibitions against women speaking out in front of men. It may also be necessary to follow up large meetings with smaller planning groups, where women’s roles, responsibilities, priorities and constraints can be elaborated in more detail. One approach used in rural areas in the global south has been to arrange meetings in situ at, for example, water supply sites, where women tend to gather regularly as part of their daily chores."

These dynamics depend on the context and existing power structures, including patriarchy, ableism, colonialism, imperialism, homophobia, and racism. Crenshaw herself has emphasized the transformative potential of intersectionality, cautioning against reducing it to merely multiplying identity categories without engaging in a deeper structural analysis or political critique. Without an intersectional approach, the global commitment to “leave no one behind” will remain an unfulfilled aspiration. Intersectionality compels us to ask critical questions: Who is being left behind, why, and under what circumstances? It reveals hidden structural barriers and underscores how experiences differ, even within marginalized or underrepresented groups. Ignoring these elements risks undermining the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and perpetuating systemic inequalities."

However, intersectionality emphasizes the interconnected nature of these issues, offering a more holistic perspective. To operationalize an intersectional lens in policies, programs, and support systems, it is essential to think holistically about what we aim to change and how we aim to change it. The framework below outlines key stages for embedding intersectionality in planning and decision-making: Analysis: How will the policy, program, or action affect those experiencing intersectional discrimination? How will it promote equality and address systemic barriers? Adaptation: How can the policy, program, or action be designed or adjusted to better meet the priorities of the most marginalized groups? Assessment: How will you evaluate whether the policy, program, or action has effectively addressed the needs and priorities of marginalized communities?"

Collecting and analyzing disaggregated data—by sex, age, ethnicity, disability status, income level, geographic location, and other intersecting factors—can uncover disparities that remain hidden in aggregated datasets. Disaggregated data enables planners to identify who is excluded from access to energy resources and services, understand the specific barriers they face, and design targeted interventions. Moreover, data must go beyond quantitative metrics to include qualitative insights that capture lived experiences, especially of marginalized communities. Inclusive data collection processes, involving communities directly, can ensure that diverse perspectives inform energy policies and programs. Without such data, energy planning risks reinforcing existing inequalities, missing the opportunity to address deeply entrenched structural barriers."
