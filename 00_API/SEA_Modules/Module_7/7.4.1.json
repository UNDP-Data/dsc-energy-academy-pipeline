A.I.-driven approaches to hybrid renewable energy systems enable efficient resource allocation, ensuring that load demands are met with minimal financial investment while maximizing system reliability and environmental benefits. For example, AI can assist in analyzing renewable energy potential and system performance to design hybrid schemes that integrate solar, wind, and hydro energy sources. Through predictive modeling and real-time adjustments, AI optimizes system operations to improve functionality and reduce costs. This is particularly significant in addressing the variability and intermittency of renewable energy sources, as A.I. algorithms can forecast energy production and manage storage systems more effectively than traditional methods (Zahraee et al. ,2016 ) However, achieving these benefits requires overcoming challenges. Studies indicate that up to 85% of A.I. projects fail due to misaligned objectives, insufficient data, or inadequate strategies. For organizations to succeed, they must develop tailored A.I. solutions aligned with specific energy optimization goals. Collaborative efforts between technical experts and energy professionals are essential to fully realize the potential of A.I."

Smart meters, which enable two-way communication between customers and the utility company, are a feature of smart grids. These meters periodically capture data on power consumption, allowing consumers to manage their energy use and supporting dynamic pricing schemes. Control and Automation of the Grid: In a smart grid, automation is important. It optimizes electricity flow, detects faults, and monitors grid performance using sophisticated algorithms and control systems. The system can react fast, frequently even before users notice, when a problem is identified, such as a power outage or voltage fluctuation."

Smart meters, for instance, enable demand-side responses and time-of-use pricing, helping to balance energy loads more effectively. While these tools are not the ultimate solution, they support the overarching goal of creating a more flexible and adaptive grid. By dynamically managing energy flows and coordinating diverse energy sources, smart grids ensure a reliable and stable energy supply, even as the share of variable renewable energy continues to grow. Programs for Demand Response: Demand response programs in smart grids empower consumers to take an active role in managing their energy consumption. Through time-of-use pricing, customers are incentivized to reduce their usage or shift it to off-peak hours when electricity demand is lower and prices are more affordable. This not only helps consumers save on energy costs but also supports grid stability by alleviating pressure during peak demand periods, contributing to more efficient load control and a more reliable energy system."

As energy poverty is one of the main issues in the region, this project targeted specific groups of households and selected them based on the following criteria: of geographical location, population density, energy vulnerability, socio-economic status, and availability of infrastructure [2]. The main objective of the project is to digitalize the energy sector in Moldova by implementing smart grid technology, which includes the installation of smart meters. This aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of energy consumption measurement, improve energy management, integrate renewable energy sources, reduce operational costs, and enable time-of-use differentiated tariffs for consumers. Ultimately, the project seeks to foster more efficient energy use, reduce energy dependency, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Smart meters will provide real-time data on consumption and energy quality, allowing for automatic and secure transmission of information to energy suppliers. This eliminates the need for manual meter readings, enables accurate billing based on actual consumption, and helps quickly identify and respond to power outages."

These households received letters informing them about their high energy use and providing tips for saving energy. In 2022, over 140,000 households in northern Moldova, serviced by FEE Nord, received these letters. The aim was to see if such letters would lead to reduced energy consumption, independent of electricity price increases. The results showed that households receiving the letters reduced their consumption by up to 22%. Households using more than 200kWh per month were the most responsive, reducing consumption significantly, while those using less were less impacted, saving between 2-8%. The most substantial impact was seen in the first three months, with reductions of 10-20%, which then fell below 10% or stabilized in subsequent months [1]. In 2023, the Fund launched an online platform as an innovative solution to combat energy crisis. \"Rabla for Household Appliances\" helps vulnerable families reduce electricity bills by replacing old appliances with energy-efficient ones. The first stage started in November 2023, and it offered free LED bulb vouchers to around 50,000 families. Vouchers will go to those registered last year in the Energy Vulnerability Information System on compensatii.gov.md, categorized as very high energy vulnerability. Priority is given to families with children, based on the number of children and their electricity consumption. Beneficiaries were notified via SMS, email, or phone about voucher availability in their compensatii.gov.md accounts.

One of the pioneering applications of A.I. in energy prediction is Google’s A.I. subsidiary, DeepMind. DeepMind created a machine learning algorithm capable of predicting wind farm productivity, i.e., forecasting wind power, up to 36 hours in advance. By training a neural network on accessible weather forecasts and historical turbine data, DeepMind's system forecasts wind power output and advises on optimal hourly delivery commitments to the power grid a day ahead. This system supports 700MW of wind capacity for powering the company's data centers and offices in the US. It enabled Google to sell wind power supply in advance, increasing its financial value by 20% by early 2019 . Other notable examples are two AI-powered applications developed by ABB in collaboration with Verdigris Technologies, designed to improve energy management in commercial and industrial buildings. The first application, ‘Energy Forecasting,’ uses machine learning algorithms to predict future energy consumption and help businesses manage peak demand, ultimately reducing electricity bills. The second application, ‘Intelligent Alerts,’ leverages AI to continuously monitor critical assets, detecting potential issues before they cause disruptions to energy supply. These applications are part of ABB's Open Innovation program, which focuses on digital transformation by providing advanced tools for better energy management and cost reduction . Together, these innovations highlight the potential of AI to optimize energy usage, lower operational costs, and improve the reliability and sustainability of energy systems."

In buildings and smart homes, internet of things (IoT) devices and smart meters can integrate with A.I. to build responsive, intelligent ecosystems. These systems provide real-time, continuous monitoring of energy consumption, for example, which enables A.I. to make data-driven decisions that maximize energy efficiency. A.I. also can be employed to optimize heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, which are significant contributors to energy consumption in buildings. By analyzing data from various sensors, A.I. can adjust HVAC in real-time based on factors like occupancy, weather conditions, and user preferences. This not only ensures optimal comfort but also reduces energy wastage."

In the transport sector, A.I. optimizes energy efficiency through fleet management and smart traffic systems. A.I. algorithms analyze data from vehicle fleets to optimize routes, reduce fuel consumption, and improve maintenance schedules, which lowers operational costs and reduces environmental impact. A.I.-powered traffic management systems also adjust traffic signals in real-time based on current traffic conditions, thereby reducing congestion, lowering fuel consumption, and decreasing emissions . In industries, A.I. significantly enhances energy efficiency by continuously monitoring and adjusting industrial processes. This involves analyzing production data to reduce energy consumption and waste, leading to improved production rates and lower operational costs. Moreover, A.I. improves production and supply chains by optimizing maintenance cycles, ensuring equipment longevity and operational efficiency24."
