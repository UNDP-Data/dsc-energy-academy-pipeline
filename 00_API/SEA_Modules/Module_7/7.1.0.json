              "text": "In this critical decade for sustainable development and climate action, global commitments such as the pledge to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030, made during the UNFCCC COP28 in the UAE, set a bold agenda. The Pact for the Future, formally adopted at the 2024 Summit of the Future, provides a governance framework to advance these goals, giving rise to the Global Digital Compact—a landmark initiative addressing five key thematic areas: digital inclusion, artificial intelligence governance, data equity, cybersecurity, and innovation for sustainable development. Achieving these targets will require decisive action, with success hinging on the strategic deployment of digital innovation, data, and AI as outlined in these frameworks. Digital tools hold immense potential to accelerate the energy transition by pinpointing high-impact investments, informing strategic decisions, and scaling renewable energy solutions. If effectively scaled, digital technologies could reduce emissions by up to 20% by 2050 across the energy, materials, and mobility sectors—three of the largest contributors to global emissions. This positions digital innovation as both a practical and cost-effective catalyst for accelerating the energy transition. However, building digital tools is only the first step; data-driven policies must create real-world impact. The energy transition is producing vast amounts of data, which can be used to address the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable energy development. The true value of data lies in its power to reveal integrated solutions for a fair and inclusive energy transition. But to fully realize this potential, strong regulatory and institutional frameworks—as envisioned in the Global Digital Compact—are essential. This chapter focuses on the basics of using data to support decision-making in the energy sector, with a particular emphasis on sustainability and equity. It examines the challenges developing countries face in using data effectively for policy-making, tracking progress, and ensuring fair outcomes. By exploring how energy data connects to economic growth, environmental impacts, and progress toward SDG7, the chapter provides a practical foundation for understanding its role in driving a fair and inclusive energy transition."
