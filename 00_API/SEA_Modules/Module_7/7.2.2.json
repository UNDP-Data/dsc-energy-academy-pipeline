              "text": "Using UNCDF's IDES, the Solomon Islands tracked progress and identified challenges in achieving an inclusive digital economy. In 2021, data for 2020 were collected through assessment workshops attended by public stakeholders . The resulting IDES report revealed a Digital Economy Score (DES) of 39%, indicating the country is in the early stages of digital economy development. The report detailed scores for infrastructure (33%), policy and regulation (49%), innovation (25%), and skills (49%). The 33% infrastructure score highlighted the need for investment to enable wider access to digital payment and financial services, especially for underserved rural populations. Key improvements include upgrading network coverage from 2G to 4G, enhancing energy access, and increasing information communication technology (ICT) ownership. The Coral Sea Cable presents an opportunity to enhance network coverage, establish a national payment switch, implement digital IDs, and provide low-cost mobile access. A score of 49% in policy and regulation reflects the government's efforts to foster a digital economy, though gaps remain. Consequently, the government updated the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) using IDES data, emphasizing digital financial services (DFS) as crucial for financial inclusion. Notably, the IDES report revealed a 22% financial inclusion gap among women, prompting the development of the first National Women's Financial Inclusion policy. In 2022 and 2023, IDES data collection saw increased participation from higher-level government partners, focusing on significant policy priorities such as digital payments. IDES reported digital payment usage at 6% in 2021 and 8% in 2022. Following these findings, the updated NFIS and the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) focused on accelerating digital banking, introducing mobile money to the country. CBSI and the Solomon Islands Telecommunications Commission (TCSL) signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance cooperation in digital finance development. Telekom launched the first mobile money service, M-Selen, which attracted 20,000 new user."

The Ministry of Communication and Aviation also launched a digital innovation unit to support local innovators. Overall, the Solomon Islands' IDES score improved to 41% in 2021 and 43% in 2022 . This progress has established the Solomon Islands as a regional pioneer in data-driven digital transformation, serving as a model for other countries. The Solomon Islands shared its expertise with other Pacific nations, such as Tonga, which officially adopted IDES in 2023. The Solomon Islands plans to collect and validate IDES data in 2024 to track further progress and set goals for continued digital transformation and inclusion."
