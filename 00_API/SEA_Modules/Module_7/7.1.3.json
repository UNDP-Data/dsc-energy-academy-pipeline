There are two main sub-processes involved; data visualization and data dissemination, both of which unpack how the user or system interacts with the data in a meaningful way. Tools such as the Energy access explorer , global electrification platform , energy data platform, and clean energy access tool showcase the impactful potential of data driven dashboards in informing strategies and accelerating sustainable energy development initiatives. Data presentation and visualization are key to effectively communicating the insights derived from the analysis, which can then be used to inform decision making. This process facilitates the translation of complex robust data into a clear and comprehensible format, enabling interaction from different types of stakeholders, policymakers, country office representatives, and researchers. The following illustrates the different mechanisms used for data presentation."
