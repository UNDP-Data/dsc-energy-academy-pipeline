              "text": "This module provides an in-depth introduction to the role of energy data in planning, monitoring, and evaluation (PM&E) for sustainable energy development. It highlights how reliable, up-to-date, and ethically sourced data underpin evidence-based decision-making, policy formulation, and the monitoring of progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7)—ensuring affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. Participants will explore the importance of standardized frameworks for data reporting, key performance indicators (KPIs), and common PM&E principles, as well as challenges such as data accessibility, quality, and ethical considerations in developing contexts. Additionally, the module introduces innovative tools, techniques, and trends—such as data science applications, energy modeling, and artificial intelligence—and their relevance for energy systems transformation. Designed for UNDP Country Offices and policymakers, the module equips participants with the foundational knowledge to leverage energy data for impactful, equitable, and sustainable outcomes."
