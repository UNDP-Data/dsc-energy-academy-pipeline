Revitalizing strategic energy planning agencies and adopting advanced planning models are often necessary to address evolving energy paradigms. These paradigms reflect the effects of climate change, shifts in global politics and financial systems, energy price volatility, and changing public expectations about the responsibilities of the energy sector. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) emphasizes that energy planning models aim to ensure decisions regarding energy demand and supply infrastructures are inclusive, comprehensive, and aligned with national sustainable development goals (IAEA, 2022). Similarly, long-term energy planning helps shape informed policy discussions by exploring socio-technical pathways in the energy sector, enabling governments to craft coherent, forward-looking policies (Akpahou et al., 2024)."

Effective energy planning extends beyond the energy sector itself, intersecting with domestic and international policies and addressing critical areas such as natural resources, industry, trade, and the environment. It provides a strategic framework for achieving clear goals, engaging stakeholders across government, the private sector, civil society, and citizens. While many nations have established strong practices in this domain, the ongoing energy transition requires a fresh evaluation of planning methodologies to meet new and evolving challenges."

Without a strategic, holistic approach, governments risk developing fragmented policies that fail to address energy and climate challenges comprehensively. Effective long-term planning should encompass the entire energy system rather than isolate its individual components. This integrated approach enables policymakers to identify and prioritize system-wide solutions, which are often overlooked when focusing on specific technologies, commodities, or sectors in isolation."

A long-term plan can significantly facilitate the country’s energy path, necessitating government action to drive meaningful change. Azerbaijan's focus on energy efficiency aims to reduce its heavy reliance on oil and gas. The assessment concludes that Azerbaijan should prioritize comprehensive energy statistics covering its entire energy supply and usage, ensuring these data are accessible through increased cooperation among government ministries. By expanding energy statistics, particularly on the demand side, Azerbaijan can use energy modelling to effectively achieve its long-term goals. Azerbaijan's timeline for developing a long-term energy strategy is uncertain due to limited demand-side data. However, strategic planning and goal-setting could begin simultaneously with the statistical survey process. To ensure accurate policy planning and energy modelling, it is crucial to collect quality energy statistics, including data on end uses of energy. The assessment advises using results from the 2018 household energy consumption survey to set targets for the residential sector. However, instead of relying on a single survey, a series of surveys conducted every two to three years is recommended to properly monitor changes in energy use. It is also advised to build different 2050 scenarios using an Energy Modelling Tool, with complexity varying depending on data availability. Given that this is one of the most pressing issues, a series of strategies are suggested to develop a minimum viable model that can be adapted to suit specific needs and answer complex questions."

To reduce such emissions and align with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the country has the opportunity to explore either of the following pathways: to introduce a carbon tax as a policy instrument to discourage the use of fossil fuels in power generation systems or to impose emission limits on power generation. To assess the viability and impacts of the proposed options, the Open-Source Energy Modeling System (OSeMOSYS) was used. OSeMOSYS is a freely available energy modeling tool developed to help developing nations model their energy systems. It is a techno-economic optimization model that uses a bottom-up modeling approach. The objective function of the tool is to minimize the net present cost of the modeled energy systems, taking into consideration user-specified constraints while meeting the exogenously defined energy demand.2 Thus, under the Moroccan case (Comparative effectiveness of environmental regulation instruments: Case of the Moroccan electricity mix), the constraints were the imposed carbon tax in the first scenario and the emission target for the second scenario. In the modeling process, an interest rate of 5% was assumed, and the capital cost of conventional power generators would remain constant while that of renewable energy technologies would continue to decrease. However, in most developing countries, such an interest rate would not be realistic, and technology costs are not certain."

              "text": "The study gave an insight into how different policy instruments can be used to achieve a particular target. However, it is imperative to assess how each will have an impact on the generation and consumption of energy. Furthermore, the study can serve as a policy recommendation on the appropriate policy instrument to implement, as in this case, a carbon tax emerged as a better option to curb carbon emissions. In addition, policies that enhance the manufacture or supply of RETs can be implemented to augment the RETs needed to meet the set emission reduction targets. In conclusion, a study of this nature can be easily replicated in any jurisdiction as long as the needed data for modeling is available, and it has highlighted that energy modeling is indeed crucial in the selection of policy instruments for sustainable energy development."
