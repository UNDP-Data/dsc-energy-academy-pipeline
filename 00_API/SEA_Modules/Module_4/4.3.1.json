According to IEA, reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 will require annual clean energy investments of over $4 trillion by the early 2030s. One organization, the Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) objective is to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030, reaching at least 11,000 gigawatts (GW). This ambitious target aligns with the commitments made by world governments at COP28 in 2023. To realize this goal, the GRA engages with governments, industry leaders, investors, non-governmental organizations, multilateral organizations, and corporations to accelerate the deployment of mobilizing finance for renewable energy technologies."

For instance, private equity and venture capital investments in battery energy storage systems, energy management, and energy storage reached $17.86 billion by August 2024, already surpassing the total of $16.17 billion for the entire previous year. Regionally, the United Kingdom has seen a significant influx of private equity and venture capital investment in the renewables sector, attracting $7.96 billion in the first nine months of 2024.

              "text": "Private sector investment in energy infrastructure from 2010 to 2020 highlights a promising shift toward renewable energy and supporting infrastructure. Renewable energy generation attracted the largest share of private investment, reaching nearly $80 billion annually during this period, with only a modest 5% decline in 2020 despite the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, while this stability underscores investor confidence and the sector’s central role in decarbonization, it falls short of the levels required to keep pace with the urgent demands of the energy transition. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will require annual clean energy investments to reach $4 trillion by the early 2030s, far exceeding current levels of public and private sector commitment. Meanwhile, investments in non-renewable energy generation declined sharply, with a 31% drop in 2020 alone, reflecting a global pivot away from fossil fuels. While this decline aligns with increasing environmental awareness, targeted policy support and decrease in costs of technologies and stricter regulations, it underscores the urgent need to replace fossil fuel-based systems with renewable alternatives at a much faster rate. Despite the progress in shifting capital toward renewables, developing economies—outside China—continue to lag in attracting private investment, creating a significant imbalance in global energy transition efforts. Although China is championing renewable energy investments, it is also important to address that they continue to be a large investor in new coal power construction. In these regions, where energy access and poverty reduction are critical, the lack of adequate private sector involvement threatens to widen the gap in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs)."

Yet, these investments, though promising, are not sufficient to modernize aging grids and scale renewable energy systems globally. For instance, the IEA notes that annual grid investment needs to triple to over $1 trillion annually by 2030 to support clean energy deployment and ensure energy security. For instance, the IEA estimates that grid investment needs to rise to USD 820 billion by 2030, and USD 1 trillion in 2040 globally, before falling back after electricity is fully decarbonised and the growth of renewables slows to match demand growth"

              "text": "Despite this significant increase in private sector investment a persistent finance gap remains, particularly in developing countries. While global clean energy investment surpassed $2 trillion annually in 2024, less than 15% of this flows into emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) outside of China. This disparity underscores a critical issue: the regions most vulnerable to climate change and in dire need of energy infrastructure receive only a fraction of the resources required to meet their sustainable energy needs. Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will require annual clean energy investments of $4 trillion per year by the early 2030s. However, in developing countries, clean energy investment needs to increase more than sevenfold, from around $150 billion annually today to over $1 trillion by 2030. Sub-Saharan Africa exemplifies this challenge, where over 600 million people still lack access to electricity. Despite being rich in renewable energy potential, the region attracts only a small portion of global renewable energy investments. For instance, in 2022, total clean energy investment in Africa was less than $25 billion and only went to a few countries, representing only 2% of global clean energy spending, despite the continent accounting for 17% of the global population. Similarly, in South Asia, parts of Southeast Asia and Central Asia, investments remain insufficient to address the growing energy demands of rapidly urbanizing populations. Without a significant increase in investment, these regions risk being locked into carbon-intensive energy systems or facing prolonged energy poverty."

Investors and financiers scrutinize the risks associated with investment projects in these regions, often demanding higher returns to compensate for perceived uncertainties. Emerging markets frequently exhibit higher levels of political, regulatory, and economic risks compared to developed economies, leading to elevated capital costs. These heightened costs diminish the attractiveness of investment opportunities, as they can erode potential returns and increase the threshold for profitability. Consequently, private sector investors may be deterred from allocating capital to emerging markets, exacerbating the challenge of mobilizing adequate funding for essential development initiatives in these regions. Efforts to mitigate the cost of capital through risk-mitigation strategies, regulatory reforms, and targeted incentives are essential to incentivize private sector involvement and unlock the economic potential of emerging markets. The high cost of capital is often a result of various investment barriers and in some cases it may not represent a problem if there is adequate revenue generation is generated by a project. In such cases, investors may still find opportunities viable despite higher financing expenses. However, when revenue generation is uncertain or insufficient, the high cost of capital can deter private sector investment, making it harder to mobilize funding for essential development initiatives. Addressing these challenges through risk-mitigation strategies, regulatory reforms, and targeted incentives can help enhance investment feasibility and unlock economic potential in emerging markets."

The limiting factors are exacerbated by risks related to fluctuating exchange rates, transaction complexity and operational risks, and political instability. Regulatory policies in developed markets have impacted the ability of their private capital providers to conduct transactions in emerging and frontier economies. Since 2008, numerous global banks have decreased their operations in emerging and frontier markets due to stricter policies that have increased the expenses associated with long-term and high-risk lending. Unintentionally, these policies have led to a lack of capital in important sectors such as infrastructure, clean energy, and local currency lending. In addition, there is also a lack of capacity such as weak policy or regulatory frameworks and limited technical capacity for the preparation of bankable, investable, and financeable transformative projects, which poses a significant barrier to scaling up sustainable investments."

              "text": "Investments in clean energy are increasingly crucially seen as both profitable and strategic by the private sector. Companies and financial institutions recognize the economic opportunities in the savings, new technologies, and products that emerge from the decarbonization effort. The expectation of a significant allocation of funds towards clean energy development, potentially reaching up to $20 trillion globally in the coming decade, underscores the private sector's pivotal role in the energy transition. In 2023, low-emissions power, primarily from renewable sources like solar, is expected to account for almost 90% of the total new investment in electricity generation. Specifically, solar investments were projected to surpass $1 billion per day, reaching $380 billion for the year, marking a significant milestone by edging spending above that in upstream oil for the first time. The private sector's interest in clean energy investment is partly driven by the potential for profit and economic interest in a growing market, and due to regulatory compliance, but also because of concerns with private firms’ own sustainability and carbon profiles and Net Zero pledges and sustainability commitments. Governments alone lack the financial capacity to drive the global clean energy transition at the required scale and tempo. Hence the private sector's engagement is crucial ."

Policies aimed at reducing the risks associated with clean energy projects and improving their return on investment can significantly influence private sector decisions. This includes tax incentives, subsidies for zero-emissions energy projects, and policies designed to ensure a stable market for clean energy. For instance, initiatives like the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have spurred a wave of investment by providing incentives for renewable energy and other clean energy sectors such as electric vehicles, CCUS, and low-carbon hydrogen among others. This policy-driven approach has initiated a global race to offer attractive investment opportunities in the renewable sector, further catalyzed by the development of local supply chains in the US and Europe and the expansion of China's supply chains. It also offers the potential to help drive down costs for clean energy systems worldwide."

              "text": "During periods of economic expansion, companies are more likely to invest in new projects, including clean energy, due to higher expected returns. In contrast, during economic downturns, investment tends to slow as companies become more risk-averse, focusing on conserving cash rather than expanding operations. Macroeconomic conditions are a critical factor in the decision-making process for private sector investments in clean energy. They not only determine the cost and availability of capital but also influence the overall risk-return profile of such projects. As such, understanding these conditions is essential for stakeholders in the renewable energy sector to navigate the complexities of financing and investing in sustainable energy solutions. Low interest rates can make borrowing cheaper, encouraging private companies to invest in clean energy projects, which are often capital-intensive and require a significant upfront investment. Conversely, high interest rates can deter investment by increasing the cost of borrowing. Therefore, central banks' monetary policies, which determine interest rates, play a crucial role in shaping the investment landscape for clean energy. Moreover, inflation can have a dual effect – on the one hand increasing the cost of materials and labor for clean energy projects, making them more expensive to develop, while on the other hand, clean energy can be seen as a future hedge against inflation, especially if traditional energy sources become more expensive due to rising commodity prices."

This trend is largely attributed to advancements in technology, economies of scale, and increased competition among manufacturers, leading to more accessible and affordable solutions. Technological innovations have significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of renewable energy and other clean energy systems. For instance, improvements in solar photovoltaic (PV) cell efficiency have allowed for greater electricity generation from the same amount of sunlight, reducing the cost per unit of electricity produced. Similarly, advancements in wind turbine technology, including taller turbines with larger rotor diameters, have enabled access to higher wind speeds and more consistent generation, improving the economics of wind energy. As the renewable energy market has expanded, manufacturers have been able to achieve economies of scale, reducing the per-unit cost of renewable energy technologies. This is particularly evident in the solar PV and wind sectors, where large-scale production has led to significant cost reductions over the past decade."

              "text": "Development banks and agencies are key players in catalyzing public and private partnerships (PPP) by closing the gap of securing adequate financing required for green transition. In 2009, KfW, a German state-owned development bank, launched a support programs for renewable energy investments. The bank started offering loans at an attractive and low interest rate through two loan programs [1]: \"Standard\" programme, which comprises of loans for electricity from solar energy (photovoltaics), biomass, biogas, wind energy, hydropower, geothermal energy as well as electricity and heat from renewable energy, generated in combined heat and power (CHP) stations [2]. \"Premium\", which offers loans and repayment bonuses for heat from renewable energy generated in geothermal and biomass plants. Both programs are open to individuals, farmers, NGOs, and private enterprises. Moreover, KfW offers low-interest rate loans for up to 20 years and up to 50 million EUR per project [3]. The primary objective of KfW's program is to encourage the development and use of renewable energy sources for electricity production by closing the gap of insufficient financing in EMDEs. KfW is doing so by supporting the construction, enlargement, and acquisition of renewable energy plants through the provision of low-interest loans. This financial assistance is designed to make it easier for companies and organizations to invest in renewable energy projects. Public and private partnerships (PPP) are essential as a finance tool to facilitate green transition, and the Mesihovina wind farm project serves as a successful example of PPP in the RBEC region. To help Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to phase-out from coal, and to take feasible actions towards its commitment to decarbonize by 2050, KfW invested in diversification of renewable energy in this BiH by funding 50.6MW onshore wind power project in Mesihovina."

              "text": "Financing included 71 million EUR reduced interest loan and 1 million EUR grant. A key partner of this initiative is Siemens-Gamesa, a manufacturer of wind turbines [4]. KfW's support in this project consists of developing agricultural land, providing, constructing, and installing 22 wind turbines, each with a capacity of 2.3 MW [4], setting up the required systems to manage the wind farm, connecting to the electrical grid, and offering consulting services throughout the planning, execution, and operational phases of the wind farm. Mesihovina wind farm is the first wind energy power plant in Bosnia and Herzegovina. With hydropower dominating renewable energy in this country, it is important to diversify the clean energy portfolio considering the high untapped potential for solar and wind energy development in the region of Balkan region. The project is active now, and it was commissioned in 2018. The wind farm produces 126 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable electricity each year, which helps to prevent 155,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually and a total of 3.1 million tonnes of CO₂ over its entire lifespan [5]. KfW's support to promote and develop diversification of renewable energy in BiH does not stop only with Mesihovina farm. KfW Development Bank is currently supporting three other wind farm projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina, either in the planning stages or under construction. In addition, KfW aims to assist the country with the development of a solar park with a capacity of 36 MW in the near future [5]. Additionally, considering the above-mentioned results of the Mesihovina project, located in a mountainous area, similar wind projects can be replicated across RBEC region in areas with mountains. In particular, in the Balkans, Caucasus and Central Asia (Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan) [4]. Key message learned from this project is that sufficient financing in renewable energy from development banks can advance the energy portfolio of highly coal dependent countries. BiH is aiming to align to the targets of EU Green Deal as a part of its EU accession process. References:"
