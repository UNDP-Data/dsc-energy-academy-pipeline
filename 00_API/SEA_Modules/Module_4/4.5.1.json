              "text": "Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) refer to a range of relationships between public and private actors for a common goal. They are commonly understood to incorporate three key elements. ● Formalized partnership defining the respective roles and responsibilities of public and private actors: There is a spectrum of possible contractual arrangements between public and private entities. These range from relatively short-term service contracts to long-term joint venture arrangements. ● Risk-sharing among public and private actors: PPPs offer a range of risk-sharing mechanisms. They recognize the differing characteristics of public and private actors and seek to optimize the effectiveness of public service delivery by allocating risks to parties most suited to address them. ● Financial reward for private parties, in line with contractual conditions and risk-sharing arrangements: This ensures alignment of interests, motivates performance, and fosters efficiency in achieving common goals These elements are captured in the following definition provided by the World Bank: “A long-term contract between a private party and a government agency, for providing a public asset or service, in which the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility.” In a broader context, PPPs can be considered as part of the range of policy and financial instruments available to public authorities to “catalyze” or “leverage” private finance. The formal characteristics of PPPs are further valuable to inform effective collaboration between public and private actors."

              "text": "As discussed earlier, the transition from economic growth to a model of sustainable development necessitates substantial investments in energy transformation. Often the energy infrastructure such as power grids, heating networks and public buildings are owned or controlled by the public entities. However, the public sector lacks the financial resources to meet the growing demand for energy investment and government spending and investments have not been sufficient to raise access to renewable (clean) energy in rural areas. This capital shortage problem could be overcome with private investments in the renewable energy sector. However, the total reliance on private sector investments may create a private monopolization of the market in the clean energy sector. Therefore, the PPP model is one of the suggested ways to raise funds for renewable energy project implementation. As a result, the importance of PPP investments in achieving energy efficiency and sustainable development goals is being recognized by nations around the world. PPP investments can play a crucial role in facilitating the expansion of renewable energy capacity. This is primarily due to their ability to provide financial support, foster collaboration, and promote mutual understanding between the private and public sectors."

The achievement of a balanced risk-sharing mechanism, close monitoring of contract and concessionaire performance, and anticipation of renegotiations are crucial factors that determine the success of PPP projects. PPP investments not only increase renewable energy production but also enhance energy efficiency. Research conducted via eight case studies highlighted that pro-poor PPP investments are the best way to increase access to renewable energy, particularly in rural areas, which can be beneficial in meeting national and programmatic targets. For instance in Spain, PPP investments helped to reduce economic risk and increased interest in sustainable energy investment."

              "text": "IFIs offer financial assistance and expert guidance for economic and social development initiatives in recipient nations, aiming to foster international economic collaboration and stability. The term “international financial institution” usually refers to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the five main multilateral development banks (MDBs): the World Bank Group, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The final four of these institutions each concentrate on specific regions and are commonly referred to as regional development banks. The IMF and the World Bank are global organizations with a specialized focus within the UN system but operate independently from it. International Financial Institutions (IFIs) only accept sovereign countries as owner-members. They have a diverse membership that includes both developing countries as borrowers and developed countries as donors. Notably, each of the MDBs also can provide financing to non-sovereign borrowers (i.e. private sector) through their own operations or through dedicated subsidiaries, such as the International Finance Corporation and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency in the case of the World Bank Group. (An exception is the International Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank Group, which lends to the private sector for approved projects in developing countries.) Regional development banks' membership is not typically restricted to countries within the region but includes nations from all over the world. Each IFI operates with its own distinct legal and operational autonomy. However, due to the significant overlap in membership among multiple IFIs, a strong level of collaboration is upheld between them. Other types of financial institutions also include key actors within the a sustainable financial systems such as central banks, national development banks (NDBs), commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, pension funds, microfinance institutions, and fintech companies. All these institutions are part of the financial eco-system that is supporting sustainable finance."

MDBs acquire financial resources for loans by borrowing from international capital markets at low rates and then lending to governments in developing countries. Very long-term loans with maturities ranging from 30 to 40 years are offered at interest rates significantly lower than market rates. The funding for these comes from direct contributions made by governments in the donor countries and is called concessional finance. Some MDBs provide grant financing primarily for technical assistance, advisory services, or project preparation."

The success of these initiatives depends on reducing financing costs and improving access to global capital markets. Many clean energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaics, require high initial investments, which IFIs help finance through low-interest loans and guarantees, effectively lowering the investment barrier for private sector partners ."

              "text": "Argentina’s renewable energy auction, RenovAr, shows how an emerging country can propose an innovative regulatory and financial mechanism to scale renewables and how IFIs can support emerging countries derisking and attracting international private investors. This mechanism has successfully mobilized USD 7 billion and almost 5 GW across 154 new renewable energy projects[1] in Argentina. In 2015, alongside the Paris Agreement, the Argentine Ministry of Environment acknowledged that renewable energies constituted less than 1% of the energy consumption of the national electricity matrix. To change this panorama, it established a target of 20% of renewables by 2025 The main obstacle to attracting investment in the Argentinian energy sector was the unstable political and macroeconomic context and the lack of national experience in financing this type of project. To leverage investors’ confidence and reduce prices, RenovAr Program was designed as a “multi-level safety net of payments and solvency guarantees”. The World Bank provided key support to this program launched in May 2016 allowing the financial risk to be minimized. RenovAr auction program consists of three rounds of public tenders between 2016 and 2018[3]. In each of the calls for bids, companies could submit their investment projects specifying the price at which they are willing to sell their generation capacity to CAMMESA, the wholesale energy market administrator via a Power Purchase Agreement for a 20-year term. This mechanism enables assigning contracts transparently and competitively, minimizing the long-term cost to be paid by consumers, and respecting the legal mandate of technological and geographic diversification. Moreover, it allows establishing incentives for the development of the national renewable generation equipment industry."

              "text": "To support RenovAr financing, the 2015 renewable energy law created the Trust Fund for the Development of Renewable Energies (FODER), a financing and reciprocal guarantee mechanism. However, for investors, this mechanism had to be accompanied by a guarantee with a longer track record. Therefore, RenovAr was complemented by the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) optional guarantee working as a Sovereign Default Guarantee. IBRD guarantee indirectly helps alleviate country risks, consequently lowering risks, and financing expenses for IPPs. Over the three rounds, the World Bank approved a guarantee envelope of USD 730 million. The percentage of bidders requesting the World Bank guarantee decreased through the three rounds illustrating the increased confidence in the Argentinian renewable market over time. Beyond the guarantee support, the World Bank and IFC accompanied the Argentine government in designing the bidding program and devising the risk mitigation structure. They also promoted the program to international investors to consolidate its credibility and attractiveness. RenovAr program demonstrates that scaling renewables can be done with restrained resources if incentives are well planned. For the World Bank, this was an example of how a middle-income country can be supported to diversify its energy mix and move closer to its climate targets. It is also an example of how the institutional support of DFIs can attract investors and recreate a partnership between investors and governments. This de-risking system can be replicated in several developing countries, particularly in Latin America."
