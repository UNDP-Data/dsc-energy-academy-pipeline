It has one of the lowest electrification rates in the world, with 568 million people lacking access to electricity in 2020 (IEA, IRENA et al. 2022). East Africa, home to three of the top five off-grid investment recipients (Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda), received 43% of the total. Pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) business models leveraged local mobile money ecosystems to attract investment to these destinations. In 2010-2021, 78% of off-grid renewables commitments (USD 2.4 billion) were PAYG-funded, with East Africa accounting for USD 917 million. Southeast Asian off-grid renewable energy investments fell 98% during the COVID-19 pandemic, making key markets more vulnerable. While most countries in the region have high or near-universal electricity access, parts of Myanmar and Cambodia (26% and 15%, respectively in 2020) still lack electricity (World Bank, 2022). The region attracted USD 137 million in off-grid renewable energy investments in 2018–2019, led by Myanmar, but in 2020–2021, investments dropped to USD 3 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic and political developments. However, there is a strong potential for the development clean energy sectors in this region. By 2030, Southeast Asia's low-carbon mobility and clean energy sectors could represent a revenue opportunity of $90 billion to $100 billion. The region is already in a strong position to meet the growing demand for components in these areas. It currently produces 9%–10% of the world's solar photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules, about half of global nickel production, and 6%–10% of all electric two-wheelers.[1]"

Despite significant gains in some regions, such as South Asia, where rapid development in the electricity sector over the last decade has greatly improved access, Sub-Saharan Africa remains notably behind. Analysis of nighttime lights and populated areas provides a stark illustration of the disparities in electricity access, showing that in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, nighttime lights - indicative of electricity usage - are primarily concentrated in urban areas, leaving densely populated rural areas without adequate access ."

              "text": "Fossil fuels continue to play a dominant role in the global energy mix and electricity generation, especially in developing countries. Approximately four-fifths of global primary energy comes from coal, oil, and gas, indicating a substantial reliance on fossil fuels. This reliance varies across regions, with some areas more dependent on specific types of fossil fuels for electricity production than others. For example, coal and gas are major sources of electricity globally, with oil contributing a smaller share. vh The financial aspect of fossil fuel consumption is also significant. In 2022, global fossil fuel subsidies reached $7 trillion, or 7.1 percent of GDP. These subsidies are not only due to undercharging for supply costs but also for not accounting for the environmental and health costs associated with fossil fuel consumption. The majority of these subsidies arise from undercharging for the costs of global warming and local air pollution ."

This underscores a significant challenge in aligning national fossil fuel production plans with global climate targets ."
