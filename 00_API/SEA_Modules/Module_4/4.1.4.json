Learners will explore how to structure energy projects to ensure they generate predictable cash flows, meet operational costs, and provide attractive returns. The lesson also examines key criteria for assessing the bankability of projects, such as risk management, legal compliance, and socio-economic impact. By the end, learners will have a clear understanding of the elements required to make energy projects investment-ready."

As mentioned earlier, annual clean energy investments in emerging and developing economies need to more than triple from USD 770 billion in 2022 to as much as USD 2.8 trillion by the early 2030s to meet rising energy demands and align with climate goals. This escalation is beyond the capacity of public financing alone, indicating a critical need for private capital mobilization. As discussed above, blended finance can play an essential role in this regard."

Addressing these policy issues is fundamental to unlocking the investment needed for the energy transition."
