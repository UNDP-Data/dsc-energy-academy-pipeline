It examines carbon pricing mechanisms, such as carbon taxes and Emissions Trading Systems (ETS), which provide economic incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The lesson also discusses the evolution of carbon markets, including compliance and voluntary markets, highlighting their role in offsetting emissions and generating revenue for climate projects. By focusing on transparency, equity, and innovative mechanisms like Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the lesson emphasizes the potential of carbon finance to drive low-carbon development while addressing challenges like greenwashing and double-counting"

Globally, more than 60 carbon pricing initiatives have been implemented (WBG, 2021). Broadly speaking, these are evenly divided between carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems. Business and investor support is also growing, with more than 2,000 companies, that have priced or plan to price carbon by 2022. While the use of carbon pricing mechanisms is increasing, it is still far from enough, with generally low price levels, despite recent upward movements in key markets, and limited geographic and sectoral coverage. Indeed, current coverage based on the existing mechanisms only accounts for 20% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the majority of emissions (85%) are priced at less than US$10 per ton of CO2, far below the price that economic models suggest is needed to meet the climate stabilization goals recommended by scientists. These mechanisms primarily include carbon taxes and emissions trading systems (ETS), each with distinct implementations and impacts."

The cap should fall predictably over time (lower caps are generally associated with higher carbon prices), and this decline rate should be reviewed periodically. Establishing a baseline requires an assessment of historical emissions and a robust projection of future emissions based on the outlook for the economy, energy technologies, and wider policies bearing on regulated sectors and firms. This can be undertaken either \"top-down\" (based on aggregate emissions) or \"bottom up\" (based on a granular assessment of emissions as well as mitigation potential and costs for each sector, subsector, or participant).

As such, eligibility conditions and limits on the number of credits which can be imported may be required.

Alternatively, a carbon tax can be integrated into excise on refined fuels. In general, imposing the tax upstream reduces the number of tax payers and thus administration costs (though this logic may not apply consistently in some markets, such as thermal coal). The key is to find a place between extraction and consumption where it is simple to tax all (or almost all) of a given fuel. Taxing \"fugitive\" emissions that do not enter the formal production chain present particular implementation challenges. It may be appropriate to make adjustments to the tax rate to reflect emissions that are otherwise unaccounted for or impose additional fees on assets, firms or industrial sectors in proportion to estimated emissions. Given these challenges, it is likely that addressing fugitive emissions should generally follow on from initial carbon tax reforms on consumed energy."

It is estimated that trading in carbon credits could reduce the cost of implementing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by more than half, amounting to as much as $250 billion by 2030. This cost-efficiency is crucial for countries, especially developing ones, as it helps them manage the financial burden of transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards green economic solutions . Progress has been made toward agreeing on the processes and methodologies that countries need to follow to access the voluntary carbon market. And there are many opportunities – not least the benefits that will accrue by diverting a share of the proceeds to support the most vulnerable countries to adapt to climate change. However, there are also serious concerns including issues related to double-counting of GHG emission reductions, human rights abuses, and greenwashing (when companies falsely market their green credentials, for example, misrepresentations of climate-neutral products or services).

Demand comes from cooperation's and private individuals who want to compensate for their carbon footprints, corporations with corporate sustainability targets, and other actors aiming to trade credits at a higher price to make a profit.

              "text": "Compliance, or regulatory, carbon markets are established by mandatory national, regional, or international carbon reduction regimes. Entities operating within these markets must adhere to regulatory caps on the total amount of greenhouse gases they can emit. The European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is one of the most prominent examples of a compliance market. It mandates large emitters within the EU to hold allowances equal to their CO2 emissions. These allowances can be either allocated for free or auctioned by the governing body. If entities emit less than their allowance, they can sell their excess; if they emit more, they must purchase allowances or face penalties. This \"cap-and-trade\" principle ensures that the market drives emissions reductions at the lowest possible cost across the economy. Compliance markets are designed to achieve specific emission reduction targets set by regulatory authorities. They are characterized by strict monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) requirements to ensure that emissions are accurately accounted for and that the integrity of the market is maintained. The goal is to provide a direct regulatory incentive for major emitters to adopt cleaner technologies and practices by making emissions a cost of doing business. One type of compliance market that many people will have heard of is emissions trading systems (ETS). Operating on a “cap-and-trade” principle, regulated businesses – or countries, as in the case of the EU ETS – are issued emission/pollution permits, or allowances by governments (which add up to a total maximum, or capped, amount). Polluters that exceed their permitted emissions must buy permits either in auctions or from others with permits available for sale (i.e., trade)."

The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), adopted under the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, is another well-known example of an international compliance market for carbon offsets and is now replaced under Article 6 / Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism. Under the CDM, emission-reduction projects in developing countries have generated carbon credits used by industrialized countries to meet part of their emission-reduction targets."

These offsets represent carbon dioxide emissions that have been reduced, avoided, or sequestered elsewhere, making it possible for buyers to compensate for their emissions. The demand in voluntary markets is primarily driven by entities aiming to meet corporate social responsibility goals, net-zero emission goals, supply chain requirements, or pre-compliance strategies in anticipation of future regulations. Voluntary markets are more flexible than compliance markets, providing participants with a wider range of project types and locations from which to source carbon credits. These markets have spawned innovations in project finance, monitoring, verification, and the development of standards and methodologies that often influence regulatory market mechanisms. Despite their flexibility and potential for innovation, voluntary markets face challenges related to standardization, transparency, and ensuring that offsets represent real, additional, and permanent emissions reductions. Voluntary carbon offsetting has emerged as a significant strategy for firms aiming to achieve their net-zero goals. This approach allows businesses, especially high-emitting industries, to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions by investing in projects that reduce or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. While carbon offsetting presents an attractive option for companies to mitigate their environmental impact, it also comes with a range of benefits and limitations that merit careful consideration."

Such projects might otherwise lack feasibility without the financial impetus provided by carbon offsetting schemes. VCOs present a cost-effective solution for those facing prohibitive costs or technical barriers in directly reducing emissions. Beyond carbon mitigation, these projects frequently bolster sustainable development by fostering job creation, biodiversity conservation, and the enhancement of local communities' resilience. However, the deployment of VCOs is not devoid of challenges. The specter of greenwashing looms, with concerns that entities might leverage offsets more for their reputational benefits than for substantive environmental impact, underscoring the need for transparent and stringent project standards. The integrity and long-term efficacy of VCO projects hinge on their ability to offer verifiable, additional, and permanent carbon reductions. Moreover, the voluntary carbon market's current regulatory landscape, characterized by its laxity compared to mandatory markets, introduces variability in project quality and pricing, necessitating enhanced standards and transparency to ensure VCOs' credibility and effectiveness."
