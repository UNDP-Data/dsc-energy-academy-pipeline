              "text": "Political and Regulatory Risks are substantial in many developing countries. Political instability, the rule of law and regulatory uncertainties often deter investment and increase borrowing costs. For instance, countries like South Sudan[1] and Venezuela[2] experience frequent political upheavals, which directly impact the stability of long-term energy projects. Similarly, regulatory frameworks that are inconsistent or unclear can create barriers to project implementation and financing, as seen in Nigeria, where changes in power sector regulations have caused disruptions in project timelines . Economic Risks also play a crucial role. Developing countries often suffer from macroeconomic instability, currency fluctuations, and limited access to capital markets. High inflation and volatile interest rates in countries like Zimbabwe[1] and Argentina[2] make it challenging to secure affordable financing. Credit risk directly affects the interest rates that lenders demand. A higher risk of default means higher costs of financing, posing significant challenges to securing affordable funding for energy transition projects.[3] Exchange rate volatility can be particularly detrimental; for example, the depreciation of the South African Rand against the US Dollar can significantly increase the cost of servicing foreign-denominated debt .[4] Additionally, developing countries often have underdeveloped financial markets, severely limiting their ability to invest in energy projects. Emerging economies account for two-thirds of the global population but hold just a tenth of the world's financial wealth, which severely limits their ability to invest in energy projects ."

New technologies, while promising, come with operational risks.[1] Infrastructure deficiencies are another significant barrier. Many rural areas in Sub-Saharan Africa lack the necessary grid infrastructure to support large-scale renewable energy projects . Market Risks such as fluctuations in energy demand and competition can also impact financial performance. Unpredictable energy demand can lead to revenue shortfalls.[3] For instance, economic downturns in countries like Brazil have led to reduced industrial energy consumption, affecting the profitability of energy projects . Energy prices can be highly volatile. Moreover, renewable energy projects in developing countries often face higher price volatility compared to those in developed markets, increasing financial risk . Environmental and Social Risks are increasingly critical in the context of energy projects. Stricter environmental regulations can increase project costs.[1] For example, compliance with environmental standards in Indonesia has led to higher initial project expenses . Additionally, projects can face resistance from local communities. In India, large-scale solar farms have encountered opposition from local populations due to land use concerns ."

              "text": "Financial Risks involve high levels of debt and unfavorable loan conditions, which can strain project finances. Excessive leverage can lead to financial distress, as many energy projects in Africa and Asia are financed through high-interest debt, which can be unsustainable. The World Bank reports that the cost of capital for renewable energy projects in developing countries is significantly higher than in developed countries, making it difficult to secure affordable financing .[1] The creditworthiness or risk perception of developing countries, especially as reflected in sovereign credit ratings. This affects not only the interest rates charged on debt but also the volume of financing available (for bonds as well as Foreign Direct Investment). According to a UNDP report, African countries face high borrowing costs due to lower credit ratings, which leads to increased interest payments and reduced access to funding. Improving credit ratings through transparent and fair rating methodologies could help lower borrowing costs and increase investment flows into energy projects in these regions.[2] Geographical Risks also significantly influence the viability and financing of energy projects. Geographical factors, such as natural disaster proneness, can impact project costs and timelines. For instance, regions susceptible to earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes, like the Caribbean or Pacific islands, face higher insurance premiums and potential damage to infrastructure, increasing overall project risk.[3] Additionally, geographical remoteness can lead to higher logistics and construction costs, as seen in rural or island communities that require extensive infrastructure development to connect to main grids. Lastly, another risk can be counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in a financial transaction—such as a power utility—may default on its obligations. In the context of developing countries, many power utilities face financial instability and are technically insolvent, meaning their liabilities exceed their assets, and they struggle to cover operational costs or debts."

For example, in countries like Tunisia and Kazakhstan, the de-risking measures has been instrumental in supporting the development of utility-scale renewable energy projects. In Tunisia, the framework helped streamline regulatory processes and provided the necessary policy support, which significantly reduced the perceived risks associated with large-scale wind energy investments."

The innovative sustainable financing mechanism of the guarantee fund helps leverage private investments in energy efficiency projects for MSMEs in Brazil, reducing financial barriers and facilitating access to capital. Investments in energy efficiency is not only contributing to achieving climate protection goals, but also improve the economic stability of MSMEs thanks to lower input costs for companies, thus generating employment and income. This case highlights how financial de-risking mechanisms can play a crucial role in unlocking private capital for sustainable energy investments.

              "text": "The DREI framework systematically identifies the barriers and associated risks which can hold back private sector investment in renewable energy. It then assists policymakers to put in place packages of targeted public interventions to address these risks. Each public intervention acts in one of three ways: either reducing, transferring or compensating for risk. The overall aim is to cost-effectively achieve a risk-return profile that catalyses private sector investment at scale. The end result is reliable, clean and affordable energy solutions in developing countries. The DREI framework consists of a suite of publicly-available methodologies, financial tools/models and resources. Current renewable energy sectors covered by the DREI framework are (i) utility-scale, (ii) on-grid rooftop PV, (iii) off-grid mini-grids, and (iv) solar home systems. The DREI is implemented in the following countries:"

              "text": "Kazakhstan, a country traditionally reliant on fossil fuels, has faced significant challenges in transitioning to renewable energy. Despite its vast potential for wind and solar energy, the renewable energy sector in Kazakhstan remained underdeveloped due to several barriers. These included high perceived risks among investors, insufficient regulatory frameworks, and a lack of technical expertise to manage and implement large-scale renewable energy projects. Recognizing the need for a strategic approach to overcome these barriers, the UNDP implemented the De-risking Renewable Energy Investment framework in Kazakhstan. This initiative aimed to catalyze private sector investment by reducing the risks associated with renewable energy projects, thus creating a more favorable environment for such investments. In Kazakhstan, DREI had significant resulted in the emissions reduction: 982,466.8 Kt CO2eq of CO2 emissions achieved since 2018, installed capacity and lifetime production of renewable energy: 62.14 MW (including 2.75 MW of small-scale renewable power plants). More than 10,000 people directly benefited from the project. Additionally, UNDP’s support in de-risking green energy investments strengthened the \"On Supporting the Use of Renewable Energy\" law, boosting private investment in renewables. The first step in the DREI framework involved a comprehensive risk assessment to identify the key barriers preventing investment in renewable energy. This included regulatory risks, such as uncertainties in government policies and tariff structures, financial risks related to currency fluctuations and capital costs, and technical risks associated with the integration of renewable energy into the existing grid. To address regulatory risks, UNDP worked closely with the Kazakh government to develop and implement supportive policies. This included the creation of feed-in tariffs, which guaranteed a fixed price for renewable energy producers, providing them with a predictable revenue stream. Additionally, UNDP supported the development of long-term energy policies that included clear targets for renewable energy adoption, thus providing greater certainty for investors. A critical component of the DREI framework in Kazakhstan was building local capacity. UNDP provided training and technical assistance to government agencies, financial institutions, and private sector stakeholders. This included workshops on renewable energy technologies, financial modeling for renewable energy projects, and the integration of renewable energy into the national grid. These efforts helped to enhance the technical expertise needed to manage and scale up renewable energy investments."

              "text": "UNDP introduced various financial instruments to reduce the perceived risks for investors. One of the key instruments was the establishment of a guarantee fund that provided partial risk guarantees to investors, covering a portion of their investment in case of default or unforeseen regulatory changes. Additionally, UNDP facilitated the introduction of green bonds, which allowed investors to finance renewable energy projects with lower risk profiles. To showcase the potential of renewable energy in Kazakhstan, UNDP supported the implementation of pilot projects across the country. These projects included the construction of wind farms and solar power plants in regions with high renewable energy potential. By demonstrating the feasibility and profitability of these projects, UNDP was able to attract further investment from the private sector. The DREI framework’s implementation in Kazakhstan has had a profound impact on the country’s renewable energy sector. Several significant outcomes have been observed One of the most notable impacts of the DREI framework has been the substantial increase in private sector investment in renewable energy. The introduction of de-risking instruments and supportive policies has reduced the perceived risks, leading to a surge in investment. For example, Kazakhstan has seen the commissioning of several large-scale wind and solar power projects, with private sector investments playing a crucial role in their development. The collaboration between UNDP and the Kazakh government resulted in significant policy reforms that have strengthened the regulatory environment for renewable energy. The establishment of clear and consistent policies has provided investors with the confidence needed to commit to long-term investments. Additionally, the capacity-building efforts have resulted in stronger institutional frameworks capable of managing and sustaining renewable energy projects"
