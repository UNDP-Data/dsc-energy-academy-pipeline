              "text": "Energy markets play a critical role in the global economy as they dictate the production, distribution, and pricing of energy resources. These markets encompass both the trade of primary energy sources—such as oil, natural gas, coal, and renewable energy—and the technologies and infrastructure that convert energy into usable forms such as electricity, heat, and fuel. Cross-border connectivity, integration and regional trade of electricity are also factors in the energy market that contribute to increasing the energy security, improved the national power grids and can diversify the supply of the energy mix to a broader mix of energy sources. The structure of energy markets reflects the interplay between supply and demand, price fluctuations, investment, and geopolitical events, which in turn impact energy prices. Disruptions in the supply chain, such as geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions or natural disasters affecting electricity grids, can lead to sharp price fluctuations, which in turn influence inflation rates, food prices, and the cost of transportation. The year 2022 was marked by a global energy crisis and geopolitical events that contributed to high inflation and a cost-of-living crisis in many parts of the world. The quick economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic had already started to drive up energy demand and prices in 2021. The war in Ukraine also led to a significant surge in energy prices across Europe, pushing up fossil fuel prices even further to unprecedented heights. In Europe’s and especially Germany this lead energy costs to increase, with broader implications for its industries and overall economy. Hence, the global energy crisis posed significant challenges for energy markets and the world economy thereafter. Governments responded with measures to shield consumers from price hikes, adding to fiscal pressures due to the added spending during the pandemic."

              "text": "Energy markets are undergoing a significant transformation due to the global shift toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. The term energy transition refers to the structural shift from fossil-based energy sources, like coal and oil, to renewable technologies such as solar, wind, and hydropower. Historically, energy transitions have taken centuries—such as the shift from biomass to coal during the Industrial Revolution. However, the current just energy transition toward cleaner energy is happening more rapidly, spurred by climate change mitigation efforts, technological advancements, and declining costs of renewables. For example, in 2022, renewables accounted for 29% of global electricity generation, up from 10% in 2010. The rapid pace of technological innovation, including advancements in energy storage (such as batteries), grid modernization, and digitalization, is expected to further accelerate the global just energy transition. The energy transition directly impacts market dynamics—from resource extraction to electricity generation, distribution, and consumption. For instance, as renewable energy generation increases, traditional fossil fuel-based energy companies face increasing competition, requiring them to adapt their business models."

In an energy market open to competition, the four main parties are producers and suppliers, distribution system operators, regulators and end-users. In this market structure, electricity generated at power plants undergoes multiple transactions in the wholesale market before reaching the end-use consumer. These transactions typically involve large quantities of electricity and a diverse array of participants, including energy producers, retailers, investment banks, and major energy consumers. This intricate relation and interplay among stakeholders underscore the complexity of energy markets, where supply chains intersect, and transactions drive the flow of energy resources from production to consumption. As renewable and distributed energy solutions become increasingly available, households redefine their role in the energy system by not only covering self consumption, but also being able to deliver energy to the grid. This is known as ‘energy prosumerism’. Energy prosumers become increasingly important in the upper middle income developing countries. At the same time, distributed energy solutions and prosumerism are highly important in the context of war and conflict affected countries and societies"

              "text": "Renewable energy investments have historically relied heavily on various support programs. However, the necessity of such support mechanisms depends on the cost competitiveness of renewable technologies, a metric that has shown significant improvement over time. The generation costs of onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity, in particular, have witnessed dramatic declines in the last decade. Projections suggest that by 2030 solar PV and onshore wind electricity will be at an even more cost-competitive level, largely due to increases in energy and carbon prices and advances in the flexibility of power systems, bringing more attractive investments for the energy market. Moreover, renewable technology budgets (RTBs) are emerging as important factors in reducing the negative environmental impacts of economic growth. RTBs are key components of innovation in green energy, aligned with SDG7 to provide global access to low-cost electricity. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to increase investments in wind, solar, thermal, and other clean energy sources while creating a conducive environment for energy financing, particularly in emerging and developing markets[1]. By supporting innovation through RTBs, the development of green technologies can be accelerated and, as a result, the share of renewable energy sources in the overall energy mix can be increased. This shift towards renewable energy sources will reduce market dependency on coal, gas, and oil, thus promoting a more sustainable and long-term market development, while mitigating the impact of climate change."

              "text": "International trade is a pivotal part of the global energy market, facilitating the movement of energy commodities across the globe to meet demand, optimize resource utilization, and support economic development. Energy trading plays a critical role within the global financial system, involving the exchange of energy commodities in financial markets. It serves as a crucial starting point in the energy supply chain, making metals and minerals very relevant in climate change mitigation efforts. This is reflected in the energy transition, which is a commodities transition at the same time, metals and minerals are critical inputs for decarbonization, clean electrification, and renewable technologies such as wind tribunes and electric vehicles (EVs). The importance of minerals and metals can be observable in the rapid growth of commodity trading pools, which reached close to $100 billion in 2022 and nearly doubled year over year. In this context, the energy transition will change the landscape of energy commodities in the international energy trade from fossil fuels to critical minerals for renewable energy technologies. In addition, it is predicted that the share of metals and minerals in the value pool will gradually increase in the coming years. The transition from hydrocarbons to low-carbon energy sources will offer opportunities in the long term. The rapid expansion of clean energy technologies indicates a significant increase in mineral demand as part of the energy transition. Particularly, considering the rapid expansion of EVs will increase the demand for critical minerals as shown in the Figure."

Dependence on fossil fuels has been impacting countries with price fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. Energy markets have created interdependencies between energy-producing and energy-consuming countries, as well as the interconnectedness of regional and global events. This has historically had geopolitical implications about political imbalances where resource-rich countries often had a position to influence the global energy policies and market. Moreover, the impact of global events and international relations has created strategic alliances and, in some cases, international tensions and interventions. Geopolitics of energy markets has influenced many regional dynamics as it is dependent on geographical flows. These flows are geographically narrow passages known as critical chokepoints, where oil transit and market had been concentrated. The geographic size of these passages makes them open to disruptions, blockades, and overall energy security challenges. Another example is natural gas which can be transported on land through pipelines and on water through shipping routes. Any global contention on these routes can affect the energy market and prices, not only having an impact on energy security challenges but also causing food insecurity caused by inflation."

This pressing need for energy transition has brought forth numerous opportunities associated with sustainable energy transformation. Not only does it offer a cleaner, more affordable, and reliable energy market, but it also addresses concerns surrounding energy security. In 2023, the renewable energy sector has witnessed remarkable growth, with investments exceeding $1.7 trillion. This surge in clean energy investments represents a 24% increase compared to investments in fossil fuels in 2023. The market cycle of the renewable energy sector completely differentiates from the traditional energy sectors. Unlike the traditional energy sectors that rely on the depletion of fossil fuels, renewable energy depends on an unlimited supply of natural resources (e.g., solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal). In this context, market players can diversify their portfolio and risk management by allocating investments in renewable energy technologies, reducing dependency on the fossil fuel-based energy sector. Investments are already flowing to take advantage of the massive deployment of renewable energy technologies and attractive opportunities that will be brought by energy transition such as socioeconomic benefits like long-term sustainable economic growth and job creation. As financial markets are projecting the peak demand for fossil fuels and rapid growth in emerging renewable technologies, capital is moving to this market accordingly. Investments also offer the opportunity to address concerns regarding climate uncertainty, which is intensified by global warming."
