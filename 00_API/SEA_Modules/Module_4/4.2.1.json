              "text": "The transition to renewable energy systems requires significant investment across a wide range of activities, from infrastructure development to research and capacity building. While private sector participation is critical, the public sector often plays a foundational role by mobilizing and channeling financial resources where market mechanisms fall short. Public finance not only supports direct investments but also creates enabling environments that reduce risks and encourage private sector participation. In other words, public funds are critical in areas where the private sector perceives higher risks or lower returns, such as in early-stage technology development or markets with less established regulatory frameworks. At its core, public finance for renewable energy operates through a structured flow of resources. This flow begins with the sources of funding, which can be broadly categorized as international and national. International sources include multilateral and bilateral institutions such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), which focus on large-scale, cross-border, or high-risk projects. National sources, including governments, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and local financial institutions, cater to the specific needs and priorities of domestic energy transitions. These funds are managed and distributed through intermediaries, including development banks, governments, and innovative platforms like carbon finance mechanisms. The intermediaries ensure that funds are directed toward priority areas, balancing short-term project needs with long-term policy objectives. The distribution is facilitated by a variety of financial instruments, ranging from direct subsidies and concessional loans to equity stakes and fiscal incentives like tax breaks or accelerated depreciation."

Approximately 30% of the spending allocated for affordability has been announced within the late six months. Despite recommendations to focus on households and industries with the greatest need, only 25% of the affordability measures are directed towards low-income households and the most affected industries. The global fight against energy poverty highlights the need for equitable access to affordable energy, recognizing it as a fundamental public service. Governments play a crucial role in ensuring that all customer categories, especially the most vulnerable, have access to energy at fair prices through targeted social protection systems. This approach is particularly relevant for developing economies, where broad energy subsidies often fail to differentiate among consumers, inadvertently benefiting wealthier households rather than those in greatest need. Implementing more targeted subsidy mechanisms can enhance energy accessibility while promoting social equity and economic sustainability. Government should prioritize support to vulnerable groups and energy poor households as a short-term solution. In the longer term, support should be provided to improve energy efficiency and empowering consumers to tackle the root cause of energy poverty (such as e.g. low efficiency of residential buildings) The European Union provides two-thirds of government affordability support globally and has experienced some of the most significant rises in electricity and gas prices in 2022. Consumer support spending levels have risen in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) due to governments compensating energy companies for operating losses incurred by maintaining stable prices during the energy crisis. EMDE governments have allocated more funds towards consumer affordability measures (USD 140 billion) than clean energy investment support (USD 90 billion) since 2020."

By sharing the financial burden and risks associated with large-scale renewable energy projects, governments can attract private sector investment, thus expanding their fiscal capacity without compromising their financial stability. In Chapter 5, PPPs will be explained in more details. These mechanisms allow for sharing the risks and benefits of clean energy projects, making them more attractive to private investors. International cooperation, including support from multilateral development banks and international financial institutions, is also essential in providing the necessary capital and expertise. Moreover, governments can play a crucial role in partnering with international cooperation and development finance institutions to support sustainable energy financing, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Multilateral development banks and international financial institutions can provide both financial and technical assistance to enhance and assess the sustainability impact of projects and help countries transition to sustainable energy systems. This support is vital for countries that lack the financial resources or expertise to develop and implement sustainable energy projects on their own. Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) and Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs) also play a crucial role in mobilizing investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. ESCOs provide comprehensive energy solutions, including audits, retrofits, and performance-based financing, allowing businesses and public institutions to reduce energy costs without upfront capital. EPCs offer a financial model where project costs are repaid through energy savings, reducing investment risks for clients. By leveraging ESCOs and EPCs, governments and businesses can accelerate the transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy systems."

Therefore, it is crucial for countries to establish sound Public Investment Management (PIM) policies and procedures. Effective PIM ensures that public investments, particularly in capital-intensive sectors like renewable energy, are efficiently planned, executed, and monitored. PIM plays a vital role in prioritizing investments based on strategic importance and socio-economic benefits, thus ensuring that limited public funds are directed towards high-impact sustainable development and energy transition projects. Moreover, PIM frameworks incorporate risk assessment and management at the project planning stage, enabling governments to identify potential risks early and design mitigation strategies.

Countries can enhance investor interest and confidence by adopting long-term, ambitious clean energy strategies, including net zero commitments, as well as leveling the playing field through phasing out fossil-fuel consumption subsidies. Such plans are most effective when backed by clear and stable policies for accelerating the uptake of renewables and low-carbon fuels, improving energy efficiency, and enhancing regulatory frameworks for grid infrastructure and distributed solutions to support system integration and access goals. Coupling these efforts with targeted public finance and remuneration mechanisms that foster competition, such as auctions, helps to stimulate investor appetite."

              "text": "Enhancing fiscal space is a critical strategy for governments, especially in the context of financing sustainable energy projects. Fiscal space refers to the financial capacity of a government to provide additional budgetary resources for public spending without jeopardizing its financial stability and sustainability. In other words, it is the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy. Governments typically use fiscal policy to promote strong and sustainable growth and reduce poverty. The role and objectives of fiscal policy gained prominence during the recent global economic crisis when governments stepped in to support financial systems, jump-start growth, create economic stimulus, and mitigate the impact of the crisis on vulnerable groups. Expanding this space is vital for supporting significant investments in clean energy and sustainability initiatives, which are essential for combating climate change and promoting economic development. For instance, implementing or reforming tax systems to increase government revenue is a fundamental approach. This can include introducing or increasing taxes on carbon emissions making the emission more costly, luxury goods, or on wealth, which not only generate revenue but can also encourage more environmentally and socially responsible behaviors."

              "text": "Similarly, redirecting subsidies from fossil fuels to clean energy sources can significantly enhance fiscal space. Fossil fuel subsidies are often substantial, draining considerable resources that could instead support sustainable energy development. The IMF estimated that globally, fossil fuel subsidies were $7 trillion in 2022, or 7.1 percent of GDP. Phasing out these subsidies, while politically challenging, can free up significant funds for investment in sustainable energy projects and energy efficiency improvements. Reforming fossil fuel subsidies, perhaps by limiting them to households that lack the ability to pay for needed minimum energy services, is critical for redirecting financial flows toward clean energy. Subsidies for fossil fuels often dwarf investments in sustainable energy and perpetuate dependence on carbon-intensive energy usage. Phasing out these subsidies, while protecting vulnerable populations through targeted support, can free up substantial resources for investment in clean energy infrastructure and services."

Advancements such as blended finance mechanisms, sovereign green bonds, and climate-specific funds like the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the EU Global Gateway, which leverages the EU budget alongside various financial instruments, including those from European multilateral and bilateral development banks, have opened new pathways for funding. Governments can leverage these opportunities by establishing robust financial architectures, aligning national policies with global climate goals, and enhancing transparency to attract foreign investments. At COP29, held in Baku, Azerbaijan, developed nations committed to mobilizing $300 billion annually by 2035 through the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance to support climate initiatives in developing countries, tripling the previous $100 billion target. This commitment aims to accelerate the transition to low-carbon economies and enhance resilience against climate change impacts. The World Bank Group has pledged to increase its climate finance allocation from 35% to 45% of total lending for fiscal year 2025, with a focus on both mitigation and adaptation efforts. Additionally, the World Bank has launched a $2 billion initiative to enhance energy security by scaling up renewable energy in emerging economies within Europe and Central Asia. These developments underscore the critical role of the public sector in mobilizing and directing international financial resources toward sustainable energy transitions."

Renewable energy projects often face significant challenges, including high upfront costs, long payback periods, and uncertain returns, which can make them less attractive to private investors. To address these issues, the public sector can employ a range of financial instruments and mechanisms to reduce perceived risks and create an enabling environment for investment. For example, loan guarantees can offer assurances to lenders by committing the public sector to cover a portion of the loan in case of borrower default, thereby reducing the cost of capital for project developers. Similarly, insurance products, such as political risk insurance, protect investors from risks like policy changes, currency instability, or project delays, providing a more stable and predictable investment landscape. Another effective mechanism is first-loss protection, where the public sector agrees to absorb initial losses in a project, thus boosting investor confidence and attracting capital from risk-averse entities. Stay tuned for deeper insights and expanded discussions on this risk mitigation strategies in the chapter 3."
