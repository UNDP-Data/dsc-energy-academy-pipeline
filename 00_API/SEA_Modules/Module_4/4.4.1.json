As an increasing number of investors look to align their portfolios with sustainability goals globally, it is important to understand how labeled bonds may help to achieve ESG as well as risk-return objectives in portfolios. Green, blue, sustainable, or sustainability-linked bonds (SLB) can help mitigate climate change risks and have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Social bonds on the other hand can finance new and existing projects with positive social outcomes. Hence, labeled bonds can help align investors’ asset allocations with their ESG and financial performance objectives. These instruments are not just available within sustainable and impact strategies, integrated ESG investors use them as well, if the pricing is attractive."

In many cases, social projects are aimed at target populations such as those living below the poverty line, marginalized communities, migrants, unemployed, women and/or sexual and gender minorities, people with disabilities, and displaced persons. Similar to green bonds, issuance of social bonds is oriented by a set of voluntary guidelines — in this case, the Social Bond Principles (SBP) from ICMA — aimed toward improved disclosure and transparency in the social bond market. They also arm investors with the information necessary to evaluate the social impact of their investments. Since 2020, we have seen a new type of social bond emerge in the form of COVID-related pandemic bonds. These bonds have UoP terms specifically aimed at mitigating COVID-19-related social issues and are particularly focused on the populations most impacted. Examples of project categories eligible for social bonds include food security and sustainable food systems, socioeconomic advancement, affordable housing, access to essential services, and affordable basic infrastructure. Social projects can include related and supporting expenditures such as research and development and, in situations where projects also have environmental benefits, issuers may determine the classification to be a social bond based on the primary objective of the underlying project."

The proceeds of SLBs are intended to be used for general purposes, hence, the use of proceeds is not a determinant in its categorization. Progress, or lack thereof, toward the selected KPIs results in a decrease or increase in the instrument’s coupon.

This bond's performance is linked to the achievement of two key performance indicators (KPIs):(a) A reduction in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (b) Preservation of natural forests, serving as a proxy for the country's carbon capture capacity The government has appointed UNDP as the official verifier responsible for assessing the attainment of these KPIs. The first KPI speaks to Uruguay efforts at decarbonization. The country has made considerable progress decarbonizing the electricity sector. Uruguay significantly boosted its renewable electricity generation, reaching 94% in 2020, up from 64% in 2012, with a mix of wind, hydro, biomass, and solar energy sources. However, there are ongoing challenges in decarbonizing other sectors, especially transportation, where energy use remains predominantly fossil fuel-based. Uruguay has laid out ambitious plans to transition to clean energy in transport, supported by robust policies and initiatives to achieve the specified KPI."

These bonds aim to fund projects that lead to substantial reductions in carbon emissions and environmental impacts, thereby promoting renewable and clean energy investments.

These funds were directed towards decarbonization projects in high-emitting sectors, helping to support the country's ambitious carbon neutrality goals. Transition bonds could be structured either as a use of proceeds bond (a class of bonds like green, social and sustainability bonds) where proceeds of bond issuance are solely used for the purpose of the transition activity or as a sustainability-linked bond (SLB), also known as Key Performance Indicator (KPI) bond, where the use of proceeds is not strictly ring-fenced but used more generally, provided issuers adhere to the well-articulated KPIs and associated performance targets (upon which issuers may benefit from a potential pay for performance - mostly in the form of a more favourable interest rate or cost of funding)"

For instance, Japan has been at the forefront of developing and issuing transition bonds, which are designed to support the country's ambitious climate goals while fostering economic growth in traditionally high-emission sectors. The Japanese government, through its Financial Services Agency and Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Ministry of Finance, and Cabinet Secretariat, has established a comprehensive framework (Japan Climate Transition Bond Framework) for these bonds, aligning them with the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles and the Climate Transition Finance Handbook. This alignment ensures high standards of transparency and impact reporting. The proceeds from these bonds are directed towards a variety of projects, including low-carbon buildings, transportation, battery technology, solar cells, wind energy, and R&D in innovative areas like hydrogen use in steelmaking."

Central to this model is the provision of robust credit enhancements from development banks or other official sector partners, which include guarantees or insurance to mitigate the perceived risks associated with thematic bonds. This risk reduction makes the bonds more attractive to private investors, particularly institutional investors with longer investment horizons, thereby lowering borrowing costs for developing countries. The influx of private capital, coupled with reduced borrowing costs, enables these nations to secure the necessary long-term capital for green projects, making thematic bonds a more viable and attractive financing tool. For instance, In Mozambique, the World Bank’s guarantee for the Mphanda Nkuwa hydroelectric project reduced investment risks, attracting substantial private sector participation. This guarantee covered potential losses, significantly lowering borrowing costs and making the project viable for private investors . Additionally, the model emphasizes the importance of capacity building and intertemporal fiscal flexibility. Technical assistance from Multilateral Development Banks will help developing economies design and implement effective green transition strategies, ensuring that the funds raised through thematic bonds are used efficiently. For instance, in Vietnam, capacity-building programs supported by the Asian Development Bank have helped local governments develop the skills needed to issue and manage thematic bonds, leading to successful bond issuances that attract international investment."

This flexibility accommodates the diverse fiscal conditions and capacities of different developing countries, ensuring that all countries, regardless of their immediate financial constraints, can benefit from the funds allocated for sustainable projects. Such an approach ensures that no country is left behind due to its fiscal limitations . To further enhance the credibility of thematic bonds, rigorous verification mechanisms will be implemented to track both project-level and aggregate sustainability performance, addressing greenwashing concerns. Implementing rigorous verification mechanisms to track sustainability performance and tying financial incentives to ambitious targets ensure that all participating countries are held to consistent standards. This transparency and accountability prevent greenwashing and ensure that the benefits of the bonds are distributed based on actual performance and commitment to green policies. Such mechanisms promote fairness by rewarding genuine efforts and contributions to sustainable development goals . Moreover, by lowering borrowing costs through credit enhancements, the donor-supported model makes thematic bonds a viable financing tool even for countries typically excluded from global markets. This inclusivity is essential for promoting fairness as it opens up opportunities for all developing countries to benefit from sustainable finance, ensuring that no country is left behind due to its financial standing ."

The introduction of frameworks like the ICMA Climate Transition Finance Handbook is a great step toward addressing these issues by providing comprehensive guidelines for the effective use of transition bonds. Moreover, implementing rigorous governance frameworks and ensuring transparent processes for project selection, fund allocation, and impact measurement are essential. This includes third-party verification and standardized impact reporting to ensure that projects financed by thematic bonds deliver their promised benefits. Thematic bonds hold significant potential to mobilize capital for sustainable development, but their transformative impact in developing economies is limited without additional support and innovative frameworks. A multi-faceted approach that includes donor support, enhanced regulatory frameworks, capacity building, and the development of local currency bond markets is essential to maximize the benefits of thematic bonds and ensure they contribute effectively to global sustainability goals."

As a country with the highest Muslim population and the limitation of its national budget. Indonesia pioneered Green Bond and Green Sukuk as one of the key levers to achieve its NZE ambitions. The country firstly implemented a budgeting system for climate change, also known as the climate budget tagging, which identifies government expenditures that deliver specific climate change benefits according to the Government of Indonesia’s climate objectives. This budget tagging results are being used to initiate new financial instruments initiative in combating climate change in the form of Green Bond and Green Sukuk. Green Sukuk, also known as Islamic Bond, is a sharia-compliant bond where all the proceeds go exclusively to finance or re-finance green projects that are closely related to climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity. The project focus is mainly around renewable energy, resilience to climate change and disaster risk areas, sustainable agriculture, waste to energy & waste management, and sustainable transportation. Therefore, this innovative financial instrument supports Indonesia’s commitment in reducing emissions based on Islamic Law principles. The two implementing actors in Indonesia’s Green Sukuk includes the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. As each of the Ministry has different interests and roles, one as the issuer of the sovereign green sukuk and the other one as the project owner in the renewable energy sector, respectively, the on-the-ground implementation requires good coordination between the ministries. To overcome this issue, there are three policy frameworks determining the flow of finance mechanisms, namely the state budget, law on Sovereign Sukuk and its subordinate legislation, and the Republic of Indonesia Green Bond and Green Sukuk Framework."

One of the most successful Green Bond and Sukuk initiative is the financing of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Through this project, the country has driven the deployment of clean energy solutions by the public and private sectors, contributing to the country’s climate change mitigation efforts. As a result, the project generated 150 kWp (kilowatts-peak) of solar power and reduced up to 137 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. By issuing Sukuk, Indonesia has been able to tap into the growing pool of ethical and faith-based investors who seek investment opportunities that align with their values. This has not only helped Indonesia access a wider range of funding sources but has also reinforced the country’s commitment to sustainable development while adhering to Islamic principles. To date, Indonesia’s Green Bond and Sukuk initiative have supported numerous projects spanning various regions including Kalimantan, East Nusa Tenggara, West Papua, East Java and Maluku, with a total of $1.96 billion [5]. One of the lessons learned from this initiative is the importance of tax incentive that could be a catalyst which directly touches issuers and investors to boost the green bond/sukuk issuance."
