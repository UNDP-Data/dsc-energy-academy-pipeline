It employs concessional lending to de-risk investments, thereby \"crowding in\" investment from commercial funders. By strategically combining concessional funding from public sources with private capital, blended finance mitigates risks and enhances the financial viability of projects that would otherwise struggle to attract private investment. This is particularly significant as estimations show that around 60% of clean energy finance for Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), excluding China, must come from the private sector. This private sector contribution is expected to rise to USD 0.9-1.1 trillion annually by the early 2030s, up from USD 135 billion today."

This approach expands the pool of bankable projects and attracts private investment. Blended finance operations aim to achieve both commercial sustainability and viability. A key measure of blended finance’s effectiveness is its “leverage,” defined as the ratio of commercial financing (from Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), sponsors, and private financiers) to the amount of concessional funds. For example, based on the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) experience, USD 1 of concessional donor funding has leveraged, on average, nearly USD 7 of additional finance, including USD 3-4 from IFC’s loan funds and USD 3-4 from commercial third-party capital."

              "text": "Similarly, co-financing syndicated lending can mobilize about USD 7 of bank credit for each USD 1 provided by multilateral development banks (MDBs). In climate transactions, the leverage ratio is often higher (USD 1 to USD 10), reflecting the relatively large project finance structures and significant deployment in middle-income countries, which have lower country risks and can attract more commercial finance. At its core, blended finance leverages various instruments to de-risk investments. Guarantees and insurance are among the most effective tools, providing coverage against political, regulatory, and currency risks. These instruments lower the cost of capital and enhance investor confidence, particularly in risk-prone environments. For instance, guarantees from MDBs significantly reduce the perceived risk, making projects more attractive to private investors. Additionally, subordinated debt is often used, with public entities providing subordinated loans that absorb initial losses, offering a security cushion for private investors. This improves the risk-return profile of projects, making them more appealing to private capital. Technical assistance and capacity-building initiatives are also essential in project preparation, helping to enhance bankability by supporting design, feasibility studies, and risk assessment."

As part of Kazakhstan's Strategy to achieve carbon neutrality, which prioritizes the gradual transition of Kazakhstan’s electricity sector to alternative and renewable energy sources by 2060, the introduction of renewable energy technologies is essential for both large-scale plants and small and medium-sized enterprises. UNDP with the support of the GEF applied De-Risking Renewable Energy Investment (DREI) methodology to test and implement new support instruments. The aim of this methodology is to target interventions and create a \"risk-return\" profile that encourages private investment to provide reliable, environmentally friendly, and affordable energy solutions in the country. UNDP financial support instruments helped secure $68 million in private investments to implement 75 green projects. These projects are estimated to reduce and avoid a total of 2,149,821 tons of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions over their lifecycles.

Projects, and the way they are financed, also need to be determined in large part by local conditions, in line with Principle 3 – for example by being tailored to local capital market conditions – to most effectively tap into commercial capital and help address potential foreign exchange issues most effectively.

Moreover, blended finance may not always be the solution to scaling up the mobilization of commercial finance and given the scarcity of development finance and wider development and climate objectives, its use should be carefully calibrated to maximize its impact."

              "text": "Establishing partnerships to structure innovative financial instruments and scale up finance will be essential to deliver the institutional goals proposed by UNDP and the Development Bank of Latin America and the Carribbean (CAF) The objective of this project is to establish the CAF-UNDP Blended Finance Facility to support NDBs and LFIs in LAC to reduce GHG emissions and mobilize and catalyze USD 5 billion from the private sector investment for Just Energy Transition and Bioeconomy by the end of 2028. The facility aims to achieve its objective by: (i) supporting NDBs and LFIs to integrate sustainability into their operations and strategies; (ii) piloting innovative green financial instruments; and (iii) structuring sustainable de risking mechanisms. UNDP will add value providing technical assistance for the following partners and activities: Local financial system: market assessments, portfolio diagnosis, financial strategies, MRV systems, financial instruments, and de-risking mechanisms. National government: enabling conditions, policies and incentives. The private sector: technical support. Public and private dialogues: establishment and coordination of dialogues for financial innovation. The facility will use different financial instruments such as concessional loans, investment grants, grants, carbon finance, and capital markets to structure cutting-edge financial instruments and de-risking mechanisms for JET and Bioeconomy to scale up private finance through NDBs and LFIs. The facility will work with the public sector to create enabling conditions for NDBs and LFIs operations. Public and private dialogues will allow financial innovation to pilot new financial instruments and regulations."
