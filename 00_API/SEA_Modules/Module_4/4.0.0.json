It explores the critical roles of public and private sector investments, innovative financing mechanisms, and the dynamics of energy markets. The module highlights the barriers to scaling renewable energy financing, including regulatory challenges, market risks, and economic disparities, and offers practical strategies like blended finance models, de-risking instruments, and policy reforms to overcome them. However, the impacts of energy finance goes beyond just financial and market strategies and also involves the development impacts of energy investments including gender, social, financial, governance, climate and environmental aspects. The module also underscores the importance of inclusivity and sustainability by integrating gender, considerations and addressing systemic inequities in energy access."
