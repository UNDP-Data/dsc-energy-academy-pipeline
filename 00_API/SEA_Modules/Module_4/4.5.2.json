It explores how overlapping identities—such as gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and disability—impact access to financial resources, leadership opportunities, and energy technologies. Women from marginalized groups, including Indigenous and rural women, face unique challenges like lack of collateral, discriminatory lending practices, and underrepresentation in decision-making processes. The lesson highlights inclusive solutions, such as gender-responsive financial instruments, capacity-building initiatives, and culturally sensitive policies, to address these inequities. It also underscores the importance of partnerships and data-driven approaches in creating equitable and sustainable energy finance systems."

              "text": "Energy finance plays a crucial role in enabling transitions to sustainable and low-carbon energy systems globally. However, the prevailing structures of energy finance often fail to account for gendered differences in energy access, decision-making, and resource distribution. This oversight exacerbates existing inequalities and undermines the potential for inclusive and sustainable development. Women, who represent a significant portion of those disproportionately impacted by energy poverty and climate change, often face systemic barriers in accessing financial resources and participating in energy-related decision-making processes. Globally, more than 750 million people lack access to electricity, and over 2.3 billion still rely on harmful fuels for cooking—a burden disproportionately borne by women. These energy deficits not only reinforce gender inequities but also limit women’s potential to act as agents of change in energy transitions. Women’s roles as primary energy users in households and as leaders in community-driven energy initiatives uniquely position them to contribute to sustainable energy development. Yet, their participation in energy finance remains minimal due to structural barriers such as lack of access to credit, underrepresentation in leadership, and gender-biased financial instruments."

Notably, 97 updated NDCs now include gender equality considerations, a significant increase from 49 in the first generation. Additionally, 21 countries have highlighted the importance of women's access to finance in their climate strategies, compared to none in previous plans. UNFCCC Gender-Responsive Budgeting Implement budgeting processes that allocate funds specifically for gender-responsive climate initiatives, ensuring that financial resources address the unique needs of women and marginalized groups. Moreover, Sustainable energy finance instruments must integrate gender considerations at every stage, from planning to implementation . One example is the National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) that are mandatory frameworks for EU Member States and candidate countries to outline how they will meet the EU’s 2030 climate and energy goals, including emissions reduction, renewables, and energy efficiency. Updated NECP guidelines require the integration of gender considerations, including assessing policy impacts on different genders, ensuring inclusive participation, and promoting equality in the energy transition."
