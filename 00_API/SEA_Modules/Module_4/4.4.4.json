              "text": "One of the most significant limitations of the de-risking energy investment is its reliance on traditional, static risk assessment models. These models typically use historical data to evaluate risks, which can be effective in stable environments but often fall short in more dynamic and unpredictable contexts. Developing economies, where political, economic, and environmental conditions can change rapidly, require more adaptive risk management tools. The static nature of current risk models means they may not capture emerging risks or sudden shifts in the investment climate or long-term impacts of climate change on energy production, leading to either overestimation or underestimation of risks. The majority of energy investment framework does not incorporate tools that allow for real-time updates to risk assessments. In volatile environments, the ability to adapt to new information is crucial for effective risk management. Without real-time monitoring and adaptability, investors may be making decisions based on outdated or incomplete information, which can lead to suboptimal outcomes. AI and big data analytics have the potential to revolutionize the way risks are managed in renewable energy investments, particularly in developing economies. By providing more accurate, real-time risk assessments, these technologies can significantly reduce the perceived risks and attract greater investment. As the field continues to evolve, AI-driven de-risking strategies are likely to become an essential component of sustainable energy investment in the regions that need it most."
