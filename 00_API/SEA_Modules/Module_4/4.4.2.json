              "text": "Developed countries have pledged to help sustainable energy finance in developing countries but have thus far fallen short of their commitments. On the one hand, many bi- and multilateral donors report challenges in disbursing their funds due to a failure to identify fundable projects. On the other hand, many developing countries report difficulties in accessing available resources due to a lack of capacity and an inability to fulfill specific requirements established by donors or financing institutions. High external debt burdens further hamper the efforts of many developing countries to access finances for setting their economies on a low-emission and climate-resilient path. External debt owed to the private sector, bilaterally to countries or multilaterally to financing institutions, is particularly high in low- and lower-middle-income countries and commonly surpasses the sustainability threshold of 30-50%% of debt relative to GDP. This debt overhang is detrimental to economic growth and an obstacle to ambitious climate goals. Debt-for-Energy (D4E) swaps are a newly proposed financial mechanism designed to support developing countries in achieving sustainable energy transitions while addressing debt challenges. D4E could offer a unique approach where a portion of a developing country's external debt is forgiven or repurchased at a discounted rate in exchange for the country committing to invest in renewable energy projects. However, they remain at a conceptual stage and have not yet been adopted in practice, though they hold great potential. This swap draws inspiration from debt-for-climate and debt-for-nature swaps, adapting these models to address the energy sector’s needs."

These were used to settle USD 21.6 million worth of Paris club debt owed by the Government of Seychelles at a discount of 6.5 percent. Moreover, as part of the deal, the government committed to use its savings to contribute funding for conservation activities for the equivalent of 280,000 USD per year for 20 years and an additional 150,000 USD per year to an endowment fund for future conservation activities. All the relevant financial transactions, as well as the selection of projects and their monitoring, review and verification, are conducted by Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (the SPV). In November 2021, the Government of Belize together with TNC finalized a debt for marine swap of USD 364 million. Under the swap, a subsidiary of TNC lent funds to Belize to buy back its superbond totaling US$553 million or 30 percent of GDP at a discounted price of 55 cents per dollar. The U.S. Development Finance Corporation provided political risk insurance, allowing the loan to have low interest rates, a grace period of 10 years, and a maturity of 19 years. Belize committed to allocate USD 4.2 million per year until 2041 for marine conservation and expand its Biodiversity Protection Zones. It also created an endowment fund of USD 23.5 million to finance marine conservation after 2041. The swap reduced Belize’s public debt by 12 percent of GDP in 2021 whilst also significantly lowering its debt service costs going into the future."

              "text": "Like a traditional debt for nature/climate transaction, a D4E transaction involves an entity agreeing to a debt reduction in return for systematic investments in renewable energy (RE). These investment in RE could be for either replacement of existing fossil fuel-based energy production or adding to existing capacity. Either way, the intervention will help to change the current energy mix of the country in favor of RE. A D4E structure can be implemented in both sovereign and private sector settings. Compared to traditional debt swaps however, a D4E instrument offers the added beneﬁt of potential payback – arising from the RE projects. This makes the transaction more beneﬁcial to the respective counterparties, particularly the debtor. Many highly indebted countries with considerable fossil fuel dependency but with significant RE potential stand to benefit from a D4E transaction. A potential benefit of D4E is the balance of payments (BoP) improvement, particularly applicable for fossil fuel-dependent countries that are net fuel importers. Many SIDS could be ideal candidates for D4E transactions due to their small size, over-dependence on fossil fuels, and considerable RE potential."

This is particularly relevant for countries who are currently heavily reliant on fossil fuels and are looking at transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy. A 100MW of energy equivalent to 4000 hours per year (not always the case) transferred from thermal to renewables, could save approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE)6. At current oil prices of USD 80 per barrel, this would translate to savings of USD 16 million per year. These BoP savings can be leveraged for various purposes including incorporating into the ﬁnancial structure of a D4E –such through incorporation of a de-risking mechanisms -- thus enhancing the ﬁnancial attractiveness and sustainability of the D4E initiative."

              "text": "For D4E swaps to be successful, certain conditions must be met. D4E swaps depend on well-designed agreements that clearly define the terms of debt relief and renewable energy commitments. The structure must ensure that investments are made in projects with a high potential for success and that debt relief effectively supports these projects. While it is true that projects with high potential for success are often concentrated in urban areas due to better-developed infrastructure, it is crucial to ensure that D4E swaps also address the needs of rural and remote regions where implementation conditions are more challenging. Successful similar examples from debt-for-climate swap demonstrate that targeted investments in rural areas can significantly benefit these regions. For instance, Kenya's debt-for-climate swap with Germany involves investing in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture projects in rural areas, enhancing food security and rural development.[1] Kenya's renewable energy sector attracts investors due to its robust legal framework, significant renewable resources, and supportive government policies including incentives like feed-in tariffs. These elements, coupled with strong market demand, create a favorable environment for renewable energy investments in both rural and urban areas. As a result of the debt-for-climate swap the Kenyan 300MW Bogoria Silale geothermal power plant is being built in exchange for the settlement of a €60 million loan that Kenya owes Germany . Similarly, Costa Rica's debt-for-nature swaps have funded extensive reforestation and conservation projects in rural areas. These cases demonstrate that with carefully designed agreements and robust monitoring mechanisms, rural regions can indeed receive substantial support and benefit from such initiatives ."

Transparency and accountability are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the swap agreements. While D4E swaps have significant potential, they are fraught with challenges that may hinder their widespread adoption and effectiveness: First, D4E swaps are inherently complex transactions involving multiple stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, and financial institutions. The legal, financial, and administrative resources required to structure and execute these deals are substantial, leading to high costs and prolonged timelines. This may deter both creditors and debtors from pursuing them on a larger scale . Additionally, managing transparency, accountability, and ownership is crucial. Ensuring that all parties adhere to high standards of transparency and accountability helps maintain the integrity of the swap agreements. Moreover, establishing clear ownership structures and responsibilities among stakeholders is essential to prevent mismanagement and ensure that the intended benefits of the swaps are realized effectively."

Debt-for-Climate swap case studies in Barbados, Belize, and Ecuador demonstrate that while these transactions offer short-term benefits, they do not significantly improve the countries' credit ratings or fundamentally alter their debt sustainability profiles. These countries continue to grapple with structural issues, such as weak institutional frameworks and large external imbalances, which constrain their creditworthiness. Third, the long-term financial health and sustainability of D4E depend heavily on the country's ability to adhere to long-term commitments amidst political and economic fluctuations. The extended implementation periods of these projects, often spanning over a decade, make them susceptible to changes in political priorities and economic conditions, which can jeopardize their success. Fourth, debtor countries may lack the institutional capacity to effectively manage large-scale energy projects. To overcome these barriers, a comprehensive approach is needed that addresses the complexity and high costs of transactions, improves financial terms, broadens the scope and impact of projects, and strengthens political and institutional support:"

This includes training government officials, improving financial management systems, and developing robust frameworks for monitoring and evaluation. Integrating into National Budgets: Supporting budgetary spending on energy transition in countries with strong public financial management can streamline the implementation of DfE swaps. This integration helps align the swaps with national priorities and enhances their long-term impact. Developing Monitoring Mechanisms: The UNDP Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) is a diagnostic tool used to assess how a country’s public finances and institutions are aligned with its climate change goals. It examines government spending related to climate action, the effectiveness of institutions managing climate finance, and policy coherence. The CPEIR helps identify gaps, improve budgeting for climate change, and strengthen governance to ensure more effective and transparent use of climate-related funds. It’s especially useful for integrating climate into national planning and budgeting processes. Policy Advocacy and Development: In addition to the measures above, a significant effort is needed to formulate new policies, regulations, and laws to effectively introduce D4E swaps. This involves extensive policy advocacy and advisory services to support governments in creating an enabling environment for D4E swaps. Developing clear legal frameworks and supportive policies is essential for ensuring the smooth execution of these swaps, fostering investor confidence, and securing the long-term sustainability of energy transition projects. Effective policy advocacy can help overcome regulatory barriers and ensure that D4E swaps are integrated into broader national development strategies, thus maximizing their impact on both debt relief and energy transition goals."

These events are one of the root causes of the rising debt levels in the region, a shrinking fiscal space, and rapidly declining GDP growth. The country of Antigua and Barbuda is faced with similar economic pressures - with the national debt levels estimated to reach high levels of 1.83 billion USD by 2029 [1]. It has further experienced costly and disastrous climate events – destroying close to 90% of the island’s infrastructure, impacting community members' livelihoods, and disrupting core economic sectors such as the tourism sector. For example, in 2017, the Island was one of the countries impacted by hurricane Irma resulting in damages that caused a 1.1% [2] drop in GDP growth. Typically, hurricanes in the Caribbean SIDS region account for roughly an 8.4% annual GDP loss [3]. This places a country in a vicious cycle of recovery loan requests for natural disasters, pushing countries towards debt distress3 scenarios - with limited resources to spare towards climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. The Government of Antigua and Barbuda has taken a proactive approach in tackling debt crisis, by positioning itself as an active climate action leader across Alliance of Small Island States and Global Energy Facility (GEF) boards and has further implemented strategic approaches to mitigating climate-imposed debt constraints to ensure that the country is well positioned to receive and scale up access to climate financing. This is demonstrated in the country’s resource mobilization strategy and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which elaborate on the adopted multifaceted climate financing approach that leverages funding from multilaterals, such as the Green Climate Fund, GEF, and the Adaptation Fund, and Bilateral and commercial creditors for debt swaps, namely, private sector and philanthropic sources as well as third-party NGOs as implementation agents."

These are some of the key enablers that have facilitated a successful implementation of the debt swap initiative, with regulatory support from the Climate Management Trust SPV ensuring that funds are directed towards sustainable resilience building and liquidity management operations. The primary objectives of the Antigua and Barbuda's debt for climate or clean energy swap initiatives are centered around supporting efforts to build the country’s resilience in managing and adapting to climate risks, supporting emission reduction, and supporting sustained economic growth, adaptation, and development. These innovative financing mechanisms allow creditors to either write off or discount national debt and re-direct the debt payments towards financing climate action. For Antigua and Barbuda these are in alignment with the country’s NDC priorities towards an 86% domestic renewable energy generation and 100% electric vehicle sales target by 2030 stipulated in the energy strategy – translating the debt swap to a debt-for-sustainable energy swap."

The key lessons derived from the Island are centered around the government’s proactive participatory approach in climate action initiatives, diverse financing options, strategic supportive partnerships with reputable public and private institutions, and compliance roadmap with relevant projects which de-risked the investment environment and improved negotiation conditions for debt swap support. One of the key challenges experienced with debt swaps are centered around fair negotiations, the time-consuming bilateral creditor political approval process, and conflicts with agreements that do not fulfil commercial creditor bottom lines.
