              "text": "Energy subsidies are government interventions that aim to lower the cost of energy production, distribution, or consumption to make energy more affordable or to support specific energy industries. These subsidies can take various forms, including direct financial support, tax breaks, price controls, or reduced-cost loans for energy projects. They are often seen in two main categories: Fossil fuel subsidies – Support for oil, coal, and gas industries through tax exemptions, price caps, or direct payments to keep energy prices low. Renewable energy subsidies – Incentives such as feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and grants that promote clean energy development and adoption. While subsidies can make energy more accessible, there is also a risk that poorly designed subsidies may encourage overconsumption, benefit wealthier consumers disproportionately, or slower the transition to cleaner energy sources. Many governments around the world are also developing subsidy reforms that are aligned with climate goals and ensure more equitable energy access."

              "text": "Energy subsidies have long been a tool for governments to make energy more affordable for consumers and stabilize economies. However, energy subsidies, particularly, those for fossil fuels, create a complex interplay between energy consumption, fiscal stability, and debt accumulation and consequently subsidies often come at a significant financial and environmental cost, particularly for developing countries. Economically, they distort market prices, encourage overconsumption, and impose substantial fiscal burdens on governments, diverting resources from essential public investments and exacerbating national debt. Environmentally, they exacerbate air pollution and contribute to global warming by promoting the use of fossil fuels over cleaner alternatives. Figure 4 illustrates the trends in fossil fuel subsidies from 2010 to 2022, categorized by fuel types such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum products. The figure shows how subsidies have varied over time, often increasing during periods of economic or political instability. For example, the significant rise in subsidies in 2022 can be linked to the energy crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These subsidies reduce the cost of fossil fuels, making them more attractive and leading to increased consumption, which delays the transition to cleaner energy sources. This figure highlights the ongoing challenge for many developing countries, where high levels of subsidies create financial pressures and make it difficult to invest in sustainable energy solutions."

              "text": "Globally, estimated fossil fuel subsidies were $7 trillion in 2022 or 7.1% of GDP with explicit and implicit subsidies accounting for 18 and 82 percent of the total, respectively. The 2022 surge in fossil fuel subsidies was primarily driven by governmental responses to the sharp increase in energy prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments worldwide implemented various measures, including price caps, tax exemptions, and direct financial support, to shield consumers and businesses from the brunt of these price hikes. This interventionist approach significantly inflated subsidy levels beyond previous expectations . These subsidies are heavily concentrated in developing nations, where they strain public finances and limit the capacity for sustainable energy investments. For instance, in Sub-Saharan Africa, countries with high fossil fuel subsidies face dual fiscal pressures: financing expensive subsidies and managing rising debt levels. This creates a \"subsidy trap\", where fiscal resources are consumed by subsidies, leaving little room for investment in renewable energy infrastructure and perpetuating a cycle of debt and underdevelopment. High fossil fuel prices disproportionately impact poorer households, yet subsidies are often poorly targeted and end up benefiting wealthier consumers more. Implementing targeted support can protect vulnerable populations from the adverse effects of subsidy removal. This ensures that the neediest continue to receive support while reducing overall subsidy costs."

              "text": "Several countries have successfully reformed their energy subsidy regimes, providing valuable lessons on how to balance fiscal health, debt management, and sustainable energy investments. In 2014, Indonesia began reducing its fuel subsidies, which had long strained its national budget. The government redirected the savings from these subsidies toward infrastructure development and social programs. This reform not only improved Indonesia's fiscal health but also facilitated investments in renewable energy. The gradual subsidy phase-out was supported by targeted cash transfers to protect the most vulnerable populations from the impact of rising fuel prices. This reform also had positive environmental and energy sector impacts. By phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, Indonesia encouraged greater energy efficiency and increased investment in renewable energy projects. The shift signaled a move toward more market-driven energy pricing, reducing wasteful consumption and laying the groundwork for a cleaner, more resilient and sustainable energy system. Overall, Indonesia’s fuel subsidy reform demonstrated how smart fiscal policy can balance economic, social, and environmental priorities, setting an example for other nations looking to transition away from fossil fuel dependence."

In December 2010, Iran implemented one of the most ambitious energy subsidy reforms in the world. The government aimed to reduce the heavy burden of subsidies on its budget and promote more efficient energy use. The reform involved phasing out subsidies on gasoline, natural gas, electricity, and other fuels, and replacing them with direct cash transfers to households. This approach ensured that the poorest and most vulnerable groups were protected from the economic shock of subsidy removal. While the reform initially succeeded in reducing energy consumption and fiscal burdens, high inflation and economic sanctions eventually undermined the purchasing power of the cash transfers, leading to public dissatisfaction."

              "text": "These cases demonstrate the complexities and challenges of phasing out fossil fuel subsidies. Moreover, the recent global energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the unsustainability of current energy systems. During such crises, the immediate priority often shifts to protecting consumers from economic hardships, which can undermine long-term commitments to phasing out subsidies. Therefore, there is a need for a balance between short-term relief and long-term policy goals. Successful reforms are typically phased in gradually to avoid sudden economic shocks. Transparency in communicating the rationale and benefits of subsidy reforms is crucial to gaining public and political support. For example, Indonesia's gradual reduction of fuel subsidies and a clear communication strategy helped mitigate public resistance. Moreover, instead of relying on emergency measures during price spikes, it is more effective to implement structural changes that reduce the overall demand for fossil fuels. This includes promoting high-efficiency and low-emission technologies and providing support to help poorer consumers manage the upfront costs of cleaner energy solutions. Investing in these areas provides lasting protection against volatile fuel prices and supports the transition to a more sustainable energy system. Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies must also be aligned with disincentivizing fossil fuels, for example through carbon pricing and simultaneously incentivizing renewables through subsidies and tax breaks. This balanced approach can accelerate the clean energy transition, promotes innovation, and ensures a fair and sustainable shift to low-carbon energy."
