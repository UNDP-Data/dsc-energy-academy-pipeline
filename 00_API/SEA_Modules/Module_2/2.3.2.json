Small-scale systems can be directly used for cooking and heating, while larger systems can generate electricity to meet additional household, community, and productive energy needs, such as agricultural processing. Biogas, produced from agricultural residues and waste, offers a promising solution for both renewable energy and improved waste management. The technology can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, reduce environmental pollution, and generate sustainable energy while creating economic opportunities. These systems are especially suitable for regions with abundant organic waste, such as agricultural areas or communities involved in livestock farming. Biogas technologies are also particularly relevant in areas that need integrated strategies to address land degradation, climate change mitigation, and energy access. Successful biogas systems require a steady supply of organic waste, such as animal manure or food scraps, to feed the digester. Moreover, the design of the digesters must be scaled according to the size of the community, with the dimensioning accounting for fluctuations in gas production due to variations in waste availability and environmental conditions."

The project is implemented by the Botswana Institute for Technology Research and Innovation (BITRI) and focuses on three key components: capacity building, the establishment of biogas plants, and the development of biogas utilization platforms. The initiative encourages low-carbon investments, public-private partnerships, and policy advocacy in South-eastern Botswana, supporting national goals to improve energy security, increase renewable energy, and reduce the country’s carbon footprint. In Rwanda, the Homebiogas project, led by UNDP, provides a sustainable solution to the clean cooking energy challenge, improving safety for women and reducing deforestation. The biogas units, powered by cow dung, provide up to six hours of cooking per day and produce fertilizer for farming. The technology is low-maintenance, self-sustaining, and lasts up to 10 years, with local engineers and families trained to maintain the systems. Financing is also supported through carbon markets and government contributions. The project has been tested in 500 households, with plans to expand to one million, offering a key opportunity to address Rwanda’s cooking energy crisis and promote sustainability."

These systems consist of solar panels that capture solar radiation and convert it into thermal energy, which is then used to heat water stored in a tank. Solar water heaters are highly effective in regions with abundant sunlight, making them an ideal solution for many parts of the world. They can be used in a wide range of applications, including household use, commercial buildings, and industrial processes that require hot water."

Strategies such as passive solar heating, natural ventilation, and shading can reduce the reliance on external energy sources for temperature control. By aligning housing design with the surrounding climate, these approaches not only improve energy efficiency but also decrease the demand for additional heating or cooling. Furthermore, bioclimatic buildings are designed with insulation and energy-efficient windows to reduce heat loss or gain, improving the overall energy efficiency of the home. Geothermal energy, which harnesses the Earth's internal heat, is another renewable energy technology with promising applications for heating and cooling. In geothermal heating systems, heat is extracted from the Earth through wells or ground heat exchangers and used to warm buildings or water. In cooling applications, geothermal systems can function as heat pumps, providing a cooling effect by transferring heat from inside a building to the ground."

This initiative allows women to store and preserve food more effectively, which enhances their ability to sell products, expand their businesses, and increase their income opportunities (UNDP Sierra Leone, 2024). In Liberia, through its Livelihood & Employment Creation Project, UNDP procured two forty-foot solar-powered prefab facilities and eight solar freezers. These innovative systems provide an affordable and sustainable solution for vegetable sellers and fishers, improving their income generation and contributing to food security. The solar-powered prefab containers and freezers use renewable solar energy to operate at much lower costs than grid electricity, making them an ideal solution for rural and off-grid areas (UNDP Liberia, 2024)."

Leveraging cost-effective minigrids, it aims to electrify 265 million people by 2030, presenting a $65 billion investment opportunity, predominantly from the private sector. AMP's primary objective is to promote access to clean energy by reducing costs, fostering innovative business models, and attracting increased commercial investment in renewable energy minigrids. For example, in countries such as Burkina Faso and Malawi, solar mini-grids are powering rural electrification and democratizing vital services like healthcare and education through the AMP projects. Additionally, south-south cooperation emerges as a powerful tool for SDG7. For example, Ethiopia, in partnership with China and Sri Lanka, is actively closing the energy access gap, facilitating a transition to a jobs-rich green economy through collaborative efforts (UNDP, 2023) Scroll below gently and play the video that will appear for an overview of this initiative:"

The AMP started its implementation in 2022 and will continue until 2027. The program has a country-based focus, while also maximizing opportunities for South-South/Triangular Cooperation and providing backstopping through an organized “chapeau” project. It is structured into two main components: a Regional Project functioning as a 'Knowledge Management' platform and 21 National Projects, each tailored to specific country contexts. The Regional Project is structured as a ‘Knowledge Management’ platform, to support the program’s National Projects, and the Africa minigrids market more generally, through four core sets of activities: Knowledge tools for both public and private actors. Tailored technical assistance to countries. Specialized regional Communities of Practice. Support for digitalization in the minigrids market. The 21 initial National Projects encompass crucial components such as: Policy and regulations. Business model innovation with private sector. Scaled-up Financing Digital and knowledge management Monitoring and Evaluation."

They also represent a diverse cross-section of African countries: both large as well as smaller markets; Anglophone, Francophone, and Lusophone countries; small island developing states; and countries in post-crisis contexts. This can create a rich and diverse mix of contexts, perspectives and experiences in the program. UNDP's modelling estimates reveal that the AMP presents a substantial investment opportunity of $65 billion in the private sector for solar-battery minigrids, with the potential to electrify 265 million people by 2030. Under Component 2 of the National Projects, the AMP supports investments in various types of minigrid pilots, including greenfield minigrids and hybridized diesel minigrids, aimed at demonstrating cost-reduction opportunities and promoting the renewable fraction of power generation."
