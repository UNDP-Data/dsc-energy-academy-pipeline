              "text": "Access to energy and inclusive energy services are essential drivers of social progress, economic growth and development, while being deeply intertwined with human rights. Even so, 685 million people around the world still lack access to energy. In many places, even where there is energy, it may not be equitably distributed, individuals may not be able to afford it and the services may be intermittent, poorly installed or unsafe. The transition to sustainable energy provides an opportunity to correct energy access imbalances throughout the world. In this module we shine a light on energy access and inclusive energy services, recognizing them as inherent human rights and essential drivers of social progress and economic growth. We illuminate the positive impacts on health, education, gender equality, and poverty reduction. We discuss global and specific challenges in addressing energy access gaps and describe innovative solutions for increasing energy access and ensuring that no one is left behind."
