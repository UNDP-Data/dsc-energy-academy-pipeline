Globally, the Multi-Dimensional Energy Poverty Index (MEPI) presents energy poverty as the lack of access to modern energy services that are essential for human development such as lighting, cooking, communication, and access to household appliances and is best understood as a multidimensional issue (Nussbaumer et al., 2012). In the African continent, the lack of access to adequate and sufficient energy services constitutes a severe development problem. The main focus when it comes to energy poverty in Africa revolves around addressing governance issues, outdated infrastructure, high energy costs, and limited access, especially in rural and remote regions (Filho et al., 2024). Meanwhile, in Latin America, energy poverty denotes “the state in which individuals or households do not have access to energy services that are reasonably priced, dependable, and environmentally friendly. This idea incorporates multiple dimensions, such as the price, accessibility, reliability, and quality of energy services” (Filho et al., 2024). In contrast, the European Union focuses on affordability and infrastructure, defining energy poverty as t “lack of access to essential energy services, caused by factors like low-income, high-energy expenditure, and poor energy efficiency of home” ( EU, 2023). These varied definitions highlight the importance of context-specific approaches to addressing energy poverty worldwide."

Moldova is highly dependent on energy imports, with over 70% of its electricity supply sourced from the Cuciurgan Power Station located in the Transnistrian region, and the remainder from imports from Ukraine. In November 2022, gas deliveries from Russia dropped by 49%, triggering an electricity production deficit and a rapid rise in energy prices ( UNDP., 2024). Electricity tariffs quadrupled, leading to inflationary pressures that severely affected household budgets. According to UNDP estimates, 71% of Moldovan households fell into the most energy-vulnerable category, spending more than 90% of their disposable income (after covering minimum subsistence needs) on heating and energy during the cold season. The energy crisis risked pushing the national poverty rate from 11% to 35%, affecting an additional 640,000 people."

The EVRF aimed to provide emergency energy compensation to households while promoting long-term goals of energy efficiency and sustainability in the country’s energy system. The program consisted in direct on-bill subsidies paid to energy suppliers, that effectively helped reduce consumers' energy costs without requiring upfront payments or reimbursements from the beneficiaries. The initiative was supported by a digital infrastructure called the Energy Vulnerability Information System (EVIS), designed to manage registration and verification processes efficiently."

For natural gas users in the highest vulnerability category, the occurrence of energy poverty dropped by 83 percentage points, while for electricity users in the same group, it decreased by 71 percentage points. The programme also helped reduce income poverty by 43% among very highly vulnerable households. The Moldova case demonstrates how targeted, data-driven approaches can effectively mitigate the effects of an energy crisis on energy poverty, while laying improving long term resilience. Key success factors included the integration of digital systems for eligibility verification, differentiated subsidy design based on vulnerability levels, and complementary programmes such as smart meter installations and appliance replacement schemes for efficiency. The EVRF’s success highlights the value of adaptable social protection systems to respond to crises and the importance of combining short-term relief with structural energy transition goals to reduce energy poverty."

UNDP has also supported the assessment of innovative financing mechanisms to scale this program in Malawi, Zimbabwe, Liberia, Namibia, and Zambia. The coordination platform financing model is scalable across geographies with specific features that can be tailored to local specificities. The platform can harmonize stakeholders’ interventions, such as UN agencies, donors, DFIs, private sector, and government entities, across countries in linking energy and health sectors. Furthermore, the financial model behind Solar for Health is designed to ensure the long-term financial and operational sustainability of solar installations through a coordinated approach. The Solar for Health Coordination Platform aligns donors, governments, private energy service providers (ESPs), and development finance institutions (DFIs) to avoid fragmentation and inefficiencies. To attract private investment and scale impact, the model aggregates projects into investment portfolios with appropriate risk-return profiles, enabling ESPs to access DFI funding through public-private partnerships (PPPs). These partnerships are structured to ensure predictable cash flows—supported by donor contributions and guarantees—which help reduce financial risks. Technical assistance mechanisms complement the financing model by building the capacity of local stakeholders and structuring power purchase agreements (PPAs). This integrated financing approach reduces upfront costs for governments while ensuring long-term service delivery, energy reliability, and resilience across the health sector.
