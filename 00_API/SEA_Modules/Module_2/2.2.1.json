This means around 600 million people in the region still lacked electricity, and over 923 million were dependent on traditional biomass, charcoal, or kerosene for cooking. The region now accounts for 83% of the global electricity access deficit, up from 50% in 2010. Annual population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, around 28.7 million people per year, is nearly equal to the annual increase in electricity access, which was 31.1 million between 2020 and 2022. This parity slows overall progress and highlights the need for faster electrification. Among the 20 countries with the largest energy access deficits, 18 are in Sub-Saharan Africa, with Nigeria (86 million), Democratic Republic of Congo (78 million), and Ethiopia (55 million) with the highest number of people lacking access, due notably to their large population."

Progress is also limited in fragile and conflict-affected settings. In these contexts, access to electricity was 57% in 2022, up from 46% in 2010. However, the absolute number of people without access increased slightly from 427 million in 2020 to 429 million in 2022 due to rapid population growth, limited infrastructure development as well as the social and economic consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic.

These neighborhoods often emerge without formal planning and lack legal recognition, which exacerbates the challenges residents face regarding infrastructure, health, and economic opportunities. Over 1.1 billion people live in ISs globally (WEF, 2023) and rapid urbanization projects that number could double in the next 30 years, particularly in developing regions (Kuffer et. al., 2019).

Historically, enforcement actions have bred distrust between utilities and ISs, hindering cooperation. Collaboration is key to improving services. Utilities must shift from punishment to partnership, engaging the informal electricity market to create a win-win situation. Legal recognition of ISs is also essential to formalize access to safer, regulated electricity."

Mountain areas, where 1.05 billion people lived in 2015 (14% of the global population), are a prominent example.

Due to their remote geographical locations, these populations face distinct social, economic, and environmental challenges along with unique energy access difficulties. As of 2021, the average electricity access rate in SIDS was around 91%, and access to clean cooking stood at 58%, significantly below the global average of 74% (UNDP., 2025). These averages, however, mask important disparities between and within countries. Geographic isolation, small markets, and reliance on imported fossil fuels make energy in SIDS expensive and volatile. Fossil fuels still make up around 75% of the electricity mix in SIDS, with approximately 60% of them importing over 90% of their fossil fuel needs . This leads to high energy costs, up to four times higher than in continental regions, with frequent supply disruptions and high public subsidies. For instance, fossil fuel subsidies reached 8% of GDP in Suriname and 3.7% in Timor-Leste, severely straining public finances that could be directed toward clean energy investments. While some SIDS like Singapore, Barbados, and the Maldives have achieved near-universal access, others face major deficits. In Papua New Guinea, only 19% of the population had access to electricity in 2022., while Vanuatu’s electricity access rate stood at 70%, and 37.4% in Guinea-Bissau. The rural-urban divide is stark, with only 1.2% of rural residents having electricity access in Haiti compared to 79.9% in urban areas, while in Kiribati rural clean cooking access is 2% versus 20% in urban areas."

This reliance exacerbates environmental degradation, increases health risks, and impacts the safety of vulnerable populations, particularly women and children. Refugee camps are frequently located in remote areas, where limited infrastructure and high logistics costs further complicate the provision of energy. To address this, humanitarian agencies spend over $108 million annually on diesel fuel, resulting in over 194,000 tons of CO₂ emissions (UNEP, 2023) (UN Refugees, 2021) Refugee camps face acute energy needs due to dense populations and limited infrastructure. Decentralized renewable energy systems, such as solar mini-grids, are emerging as effective alternatives. These systems are faster to deploy and less capital-intensive than centralized grids, making them more adaptable to remote and temporary camp settings."

              "text": "Environmental hazards, crises, and conflict settings often result in severe energy infrastructure damage or complete destruction, making reliable energy access scarce. Centralized energy infrastructure is highly vulnerable to damage due to its reliance on long transmission lines, single points of failure, and limited flexibility in the face of shocks. This makes decentralized energy solutions essential for resilience. Distributed energy systems, such as solar-powered mini-grids, can quickly restore power to critical facilities, including health clinics and water systems. Given their smaller size, they are also less apt to be disrupted by military events in conflict prone regions. Mobile renewable energy units have also proven effective in providing immediate energy solutions during crises."

              "text": "Resilient energy infrastructure plays a crucial role in post-crisis recovery. The UNDP Sustainable Energy Hub (SEH) defines energy resilience in fragile contexts as the ability of individuals, communities, and systems to withstand and recover from shocks and stresses related to energy supply, demand, and access. For instance, recovery plans can include tailored strategies for sustainable and resilient energy integration, such as financing mechanisms to de-risk investments and incentivize private sector participation to address funding shortages. The intersection of the climate crisis and fragility underscores the need for long-term resilience planning. For example, integrating renewable energy into health systems during crises, as demonstrated in past outbreaks like COVID-19, has shown that sustainable energy can simultaneously address immediate needs and create pathways for green recovery. Energy access in fragile and conflict contexts requires targeted interventions that combine immediate solutions with long-term sustainable strategies. Decentralized renewable energy systems—such as solar home systems, mini-grids, solar-powered water pumps, and portable clean energy units—offer adaptable and rapidly deployable solutions that can operate independently of vulnerable central grids. These systems can be well-suited for remote or insecure areas where infrastructure is damaged or non-existent. By scaling such technologies, fostering innovative financing mechanisms, and embedding energy resilience into broader recovery and development strategies, it is possible to mitigate the impacts of crises and ensure more reliable support for vulnerable populations."
