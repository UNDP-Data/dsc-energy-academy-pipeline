This translates to an estimated 10 million more people lacking electricity, bringing the total to 685 million globally (WB, 2024) While progress has been made, clean cooking access remains stagnant, with 2.1 billion people still relying on harmful methods such as traditional biomass, charcoal, and kerosene, which contribute to indoor air pollution and gender inequities. Globally, 1.2 billion people lack adequate access to cooling, putting at risk their ability to survive extreme heat, store nutritious food, and safely receive vaccines (SE4All, 2022) Moreover, 1.18 billion people are energy poor (UNDP, 2024). Recent studies highlight a crucial aspect: energy poverty often persists even near established grids. This underscores the diverse types of energy needs and highlights the multifaceted nature of the challenge. Indeed, proximity to energy infrastructure doesn’t guarantee access to it, or the ability to use it for fundamental needs"

Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) seeks to address this gap by ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. However, while universal energy access is clearly recognized as essential for development, it is not formally recognized as a standalone human right in international law.

Emergency services and early warning systems for environmental hazards also rely on energy to function effectively. Moreover, energy contributes to public safety thanks to street lighting and household lighting, both of which contribute to reducing crime particularly in urban and peri-urban areas.

This inequality can have cascading negative effects across sectors, limiting opportunities for education, health, and employment. In many parts of the world, women spend up to 18 hours weekly collecting fuel for cooking, while children may have to skip school to assist - time that could otherwise be spent for education or earning income, thus reinforcing cycles of poverty and gender inequality (UNDP, 2024)."

The COVID-19 pandemic made this need especially evident, as remote learning became the norm in many regions, highlighting the digital divide exacerbated by energy poverty. Without electricity, millions of children around the world were unable to continue their education and were delayed in their learning process. Given the importance of energy access to realize fundamental and internationally recognized human rights, it is important that energy policies and programs are designed to empower individuals and communities to claim their rights and participate fully in social, economic, and political life. As the global community works toward SDG 7, there is a critical need to recognize energy beyond just infrastructure, as a foundation for dignity, equality, and human development."

Additionally, cooling needs, including refrigeration for food storage, are crucial for maintaining food safety and quality, especially with rising demand for cooling due to climate change and rising global temperatures."

Reliable energy access powers water heating and pumping, which are crucial for sanitation and hygiene, supporting WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) services in households, schools, and community centers. Access to clean water and proper sanitation, made possible through energy, is directly linked to public health and gender equality, particularly in education, where girls are disproportionately affected by inadequate WASH facilities. Additionally, energy supports household automation and appliances, such as washing machines that alleviate manual labor. Access to energy also facilitates remote work and online education bridging connectivity gaps and enhancing quality of life."

Whether it's powering irrigation systems for agriculture, running equipment for local businesses, or supporting manufacturing processes, productive energy use helps communities thrive economically and socially. It enhances the profitability of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). For example, an electric sewing machine or a milk cooling tank for farmers can significantly improve production and income. This allows entrepreneurs to employ others or invest in better health and education for their families."
