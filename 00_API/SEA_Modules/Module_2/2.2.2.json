However, these figures may underestimate the true scale of the issue, as energy access metrics often count a household as “electrified” based on a single point of connection, even if electricity was only available for a day at some point in time. This can mask the reality of unreliable, insufficient, or unusable electricity services, especially in fragile or informal settings.

              "text": "These variations in electricity access highlight the vast differences in how countries and institutions define and measure access, which is an important distinction shaping both data and policy responses. In some contexts, electricity access is defined simply as a physical connection to the grid, regardless of quality or reliability. In others, it includes minimum service levels such as the ability to power basic appliances, number of hours of supply per day, or affordability. For example, India considers a village electrified if at least 10% of households and public institutions have access to electricity (PRS India., 2017) while the World Bank’s Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) assesses access based on capacity, duration, reliability, quality, affordability, legality, and safety (ESMAP, 2015). These contrasting definitions can lead to major discrepancies in reporting and in understanding the real impact of electrification efforts. To ensure meaningful progress toward universal energy access, strategies must be tailored to regional and national contexts, taking into account not just connection rates but also the quality, reliability, and inclusiveness of energy services. This is particularly critical in underserved rural areas and informal settlements, where basic energy needs often remain unmet despite being counted as “electrified.”"

In low-access African countries, over 53% of infant mortality is linked to pollution-related illnesses (Showbande, 2020). The burden of collecting biomass falls largely on women and girls—400 million of whom are biomass producers in the global energy system. In Sub-Saharan Africa, they spend five hours daily on cooking tasks, limiting education and work opportunities and costing the global economy $800 billion annually (UNDP SEH, 2024). Clean cooking solutions could alleviate this \"time poverty.\" In conflict zones, lack of clean cooking options also heightens exposure to gender-based violence, such as the 42% of such cases in Chad occurring during firewood collection (Clean Cooking Alliance, n.d.)."

The access deficit has consistently declined in Eastern, Southeastern, Central, and Southern Asia, driven by gains in the most populous low- and middle-income countries like India, China, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan. However, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind, with 79% of its population and 33% in Central and Southern Asia still relying on polluting fuels.

For example regarding health, air conditioning decreases heat-related mortality by 80% (Shapiro et al, 2016), aggravating health inequalities for those who have no access. Moreover, several studies have connected heat with slower learning, having long-term implications on educational and career outcomes (Zivin, et al, 2020). Heating and cooling play a significant role in both the environment and climate change, accounting for nearly half of global final energy consumption. As the largest source of energy end use, it is responsible for over 40% of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, despite a decrease in the share of fossil fuels in heat generation from 91% in 2010 to 75% in 2021, most heat generation still relies on fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and unsustainable biomass. Therefore, electrification is essential for achieving universal energy access in unserved regions and for decarbonizing heating and cooling to ensure sustainability (IRENA, 2023)."

Global cooling demand is projected to grow by 45% by 2050 compared to 2016 levels (IRENA, 2023). Projections indicate that by 2050, at least 80% of the world’s wealthiest households will have air conditioning, while only 2% to 23% of the poorest households will have access. While regions like North America are over-equipped, only 15% of the 3.5 billion people living in hot climates currently have air conditioning (PreventionWeb, 2023).

Heating and cooling solutions span a spectrum of technologies, ranging from traditional methods such as open fires and stoves, to modern appliances. The use of different fuels further complicates the landscape, with regions relying on biomass, fossil fuels, or electricity based on local availability and economic factors. The multifaceted nature of these technologies and fuels makes it challenging to develop a uniform metric for assessing global access. The diverse climatic conditions across regions add another layer of complexity. While some areas require robust heating solutions for colder seasons, others face challenges related to excessive heat, necessitating effective cooling technologies. The dynamic nature of climate-related energy needs emphasizes the importance of region-specific strategies to ensure that populations can access suitable heating and cooling solutions. Specific business and financing models are needed to address heating and cooling access, which will be developed in Chapter 3 in this module, and in module 4 for the financing mechanisms."

The data shows that 1.12 billion people are considered at high risk due to a lack of access to cooling. This includes 306.1 million rural poor lacking electricity access, and 815.0 million urban poor facing challenges with housing quality and intermittent electricity supply. The analysis considers various factors of vulnerability, tracking progress annually with the best available data. It strategically categorizes populations into high, medium, and low-risk groups based on their access to cooling for thermal comfort, food and agricultural produce, and medical products."

The gender-disaggregated data reveals that women constitute approximately 53% of this population, possibly indicating a higher vulnerability among women compared to men due to intersecting disparities. The recent reduction in the number of people at high risk within the assessment countries, from 1.14 billion to 1.12 billion, signals progress. India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Yemen (prior to the recent civil war) have witnessed substantial reductions in their rural poor populations at high risk, driven by efforts to expand electricity access and reduce poverty. However, the number of urban poor at high risk increased slightly, emphasizing the ongoing challenges associated with rapid urbanization.

Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach that combines efforts to improve electricity access, housing quality, and the affordability of efficient cooling solutions. The data underscores the importance of tailored interventions to ensure sustainable and equitable access to cooling technologies worldwide. The dynamic nature of climate-related energy needs emphasizes the need for region-specific strategies to ensure that populations can access suitable heating and cooling solutions."
