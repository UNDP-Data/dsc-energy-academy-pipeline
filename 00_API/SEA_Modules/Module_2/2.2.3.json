              "text": "Insufficient energy infrastructure refers to energy systems that lack the capacity, connectivity, and resilience needed to meet current and future energy demands. This includes underdeveloped or outdated infrastructure for generation, transmission, and distribution, which collectively form the backbone of any functional energy system. As defined by the World Economic Forum (WEF., 2024), infrastructure must be “fit-for-purpose, future-ready, and aligned with decarbonization goals”, a standard that many systems in developing and fragile contexts still fall short of. These shortcomings restrict energy services which has more striking consequences in remote areas and fragile contexts. The high costs and complexities associated with extending infrastructure often leave these regions without reliable access to electricity or fuels for cooking, heating, and cooling. Regular maintenance of existing infrastructure is frequently overlooked due to funding constraints or logistical challenges. Aging and poorly maintained equipment increase the risk of energy outages, especially in low-income or remote areas where resources for repairs are scarce. Moreover, there is often a shortage of skilled local workers who can maintain this infrastructure to quality standards. This lack of expertise compromises both safety and the longevity of energy services. Insufficient generation capacity exacerbates these issues. In many electricity networks, generation capacity fails to meet demand, leading to frequent interruptions in supply, such as blackouts. This reduces resilience against external shocks. Additionally, many regions, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS), rely heavily on imported fuels. This reliance makes them particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy markets. Energy supply chain disruptions pose another significant barrier to vulnerable populations. In many developing countries, issues such as pipeline damage, geopolitical tensions, price fluctuations, and even climate events disrupt energy source operations. These disruptions lead to underutilization of available resources and jeopardizing the secure electricity supply."

However, this recovery did not reverse a long-term decline, with least-developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), and small island developing states (SIDS) facing significant gaps that risk delaying progress toward universal energy access (IEA et al., 2024). Investment remains highly concentrated, with 80% of commitments going to just 25 countries in 2022. Between 2010 and 2022, LLDCs attracted more finance than LDCs. Flows to SIDS reflect the most even distribution relative to their population, with 80 percent of investments going to countries in which 86 percent of the population lives.

High cost of capital: Limited access to affordable financing and underdeveloped financial markets raise the cost of capital, making projects less bankable. Currency and exchange rate risks: Local revenues in unstable currencies and debt in foreign currency create financial uncertainty for investors Political and regulatory risk: Frequent policy shifts, lack of transparency, or risk of expropriation discourage foreign direct investment. Unclear policy frameworks: Inconsistent or poorly enforced energy regulations reduce investor confidence and may increase project development risks. Challenges to renewable energy investments and solutions to surmount them will be further developed in module 4."

In many developing countries, this capacity is limited by human resource shortages, lack of technical expertise, and weak coordination between stakeholders. For instance, in Tanzania, research overlapping mandates and poor communication among local government institutions slowed down efforts to improve energy access and efficiency in rural areas (Chisom., 2021). Without strong institutions able to coordinate across sectors, set performance targets, and engage communities for inclusive energy access, electrification efforts remain unfulfilled. Capacity-building, both at the central and local government levels, is critical to ensure that energy planning and delivery systems are efficient and inclusive."

In many countries, electricity tariffs are set below cost-recovery levels— which means that the price consumers pay for electricity is less than the actual cost of producing, transmitting, and distributing it. This is often done as a means to protect low-income consumers, but can lead to financial losses for utilities, and discourage private investment. A recent study found that poorly targeted subsidies and underpriced electricity were contributors to utility debt and limited the ability of energy providers to expand services (Ali & Li., 2024). More targeted subsidies or tiered pricing models could help improve affordability, thus preserving inclusive energy access for lower-income households who need it the most, without distorting financial viability."

              "text": "Global estimations predominantly revolve around the availability aspect of electricity access. This is primarily because monitoring the other facets of access mentioned earlier presents additional challenges. In terms of affordability, the concept of “Fuel Poverty” offers valuable insights into monitoring households' energy expenditures relative to their total income, as presented in chapter 1. However, cultural, climatic, and regional differences may impact the cost of energy services and the income required to afford them, making it challenging to establish universal benchmarks for fuel poverty. Thus, while monitoring households' energy expenditures relative to their total income offers valuable insights into affordability, there is no comprehensive fuel poverty tracking index on a global scale. Most of the existing fuel poverty indexes are assessed at the national level, with limited efforts to apply them regionally. Even so, the metrics used to quantify fuel poverty can vary across regions, and a one-size-fits-all approach may not capture the nuanced socio-economic dynamics that influence energy affordability. Another conundrum is that focusing solely on affordability may overlook other dimensions of sustainable energy access, such as reliability, safety, and environmental sustainability. Measuring access to heating and cooling solutions introduces further complexities due to the diverse technologies and fuels involved, as well as varying climatic needs, as shown in Lesson 2.2."

Without disaggregated data, it becomes difficult to identify and address the specific needs and barriers faced by marginalized groups. Additionally, a lack of understanding on consumer preferences, in developing countries- meaning what technologies or tools are most adapted to cultural and societal habits- can hinder the design of socially acceptable energy access solutions. Given that consumer preferences may vary depending on geographic location and culture, obtaining such data is important. In order to address the specific needs and barriers faced by marginal groups, it's important to obtain broad socio-economic data that is disaggregated - e.g., by gender, income level, etc. A comprehensive approach to measuring energy access should incorporate multidimensional factors to ensure a holistic understanding of the challenges faced by communities in securing clean and sustainable energy services."
