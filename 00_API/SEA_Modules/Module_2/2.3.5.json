This lesson explores how data, digital technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming the way energy systems are designed, managed, and financed in low- and middle-income countries. You’ll learn how geospatial data and platforms like the Global Electrification Platform and Energy Access Explorer enable planners to identify high-need areas and select the most cost-effective solutions. The lesson also highlights the role of AI in improving reliability and efficiency—through smarter demand forecasting, microgrid optimization, and fault detection—especially in remote or fragile contexts. Finally, it examines how mobile money and peer-to-peer energy trading are expanding affordability and inclusion, empowering users to pay flexibly and participate directly in local energy markets. Together, these tools are helping close the energy access gap while supporting more equitable and sustainable energy systems."

These methods frequently overlook informal settlements, rural populations who may be dispersed across a territory, and seasonal energy demand fluctuations. Without detailed and reliable data, energy planners risk misallocating investments or extending grids into areas where decentralized solutions such as solar mini-grids or standalone systems would be more cost-effective and reliable. Geospatial data, referring to location-based information that is used to more effectively map, analyze, and plan energy access and distribution solutions can bring a new dimension to energy planning by allowing for spatial analysis of people’s living location, their proximity to existing grids, solar radiation levels, road access, and more. By layering these variables in a geographic information system (GIS), planners can create detailed energy access maps that identify which communities lack electricity, and what is the most appropriate technology and delivery model for each context. This allows for decisionmakers and investors to compare different energy solutions such as grid extension, mini-grids, or standalone solutions."

              "text": "Geospatial tools enable the possibility to identify underserved areas with high energy needs that can be invisible in traditional datasets. For example, the Energy Access Explorer (EAE) platform uses data layers like health facility locations ( as displayed in the map) , productive use potential, night-time light intensity, and socioeconomic factors to identify where investments for energy access can have the biggest impact. This is particularly relevant in fragile contexts or regions with informal urbanization where official grid maps may be outdated or incomplete. Geospatial planning tools can also incorporate predictive modeling, which are algorithms and simulations to forecast future energy demand, to determine the most cost-effective technology for expanding electricity access. For example, the Global Electrification Platform (GEP) uses simulations of multiple scenarios to compare the costs of grid extension versus mini-grid or standalone solar systems under different demand assumptions. This allows policymakers to direct investments more efficiently, ensuring limited public funds are used where they have the highest return in terms of access per dollar spent. According to ESMAP, least-cost geospatial modeling in Nigeria determines that mini-grids were the most cost-effective option to electrify 30 million people, and standalone solar can serve another 20 million (ESMAP., 2022)."

Blockchain ensures transparency, trust, and reliable transaction records through smart contracts, that removes the need for intermediaries. At the same time, IoT devices allow for real-time energy data monitoring, linking prosumers and consumers through smart meters and gateways that track production and consumption at a granular level. When combined, these technologies can create secure, autonomous energy markets that enable local energy trading, even in areas with minimal internet connectivity. Blockchain’s distributed ledger, which is a decentralized system where transactions are recorded across multiple nodes, ensures transparency and trust among participants without the need for central authority. This ledger also enables tokenized payments, where units of energy can be represented as digital tokens exchanged securely between users, allowing fast, low-cost, and verifiable peer-to-peer energy settlements."

Pilot projects like those in Bangladesh and Kenya are already exploring these models to enhance rural electrification and economic inclusion ."

              "text": "In many developing regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, traditional banking infrastructure remains limited, leaving vast segments of the population without access to essential financial services. As of 2021, around 1.4 billion adults globally were unbanked, including approximately 360 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, representing about 45% of the region’s population (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2022). Mobile money platforms represent potential solutions to bridge this gap, and allow off-grid households to access, afford, and manage renewable energy solutions. Mobile money services, such as Kenya's M-Pesa, have disrupted mobile money platforms and contributed tofinancial inclusion by allowing users to perform transactions via mobile phones without the need for a traditional bank account. M-PESA, launched by Safaricom in Kenya in 2007, is a mobile-based electronic payment and money transfer system. By 2010, it had reached over 9 million users, around 40% of Kenya's adult population at the time, and facilitated over $320 million in monthly person-to-person transfers. (Mas & Radcliffe., 2010). The platform enables users, even in rural and underserved areas, to deposit, withdraw, and transfer money using simple mobile phones through a vast network of over 16,900 retail agents. M-PESA may have contributed to making energy access more affordable and inclusive by allowing customers to pay energy bills, including electricity, digitally and securely. For example, Kenya's main utility company reported that around 20% of its customers paid their bills through M-PESA, which shows how mobile money can bridge financial gaps and improve access to essential energy services . In combination with the accelerated adoption of mobile payment, pay-as-you-go solar energy models, where customers make incremental payments for solar home systems can also contribute to making energy more accessible. This model allows low-income households to paying small, manageable amounts that align with their cash flow. This flexibility can improve affordability and empower previously underserved communities to access clean, reliable electricity for the first time."

              "text": "The digital divide refers to the disparity between individuals who have access to modern information and communication technologies (ICT) and those who do not. This gap is particularly evident between the Global North and the Global South, where limited internet access in developing countries hampers educational opportunities, economic development, and access to essential services. Globally, as of 2022, approximately 2.7 billion people—representing one-third of the world's population—remain offline, with the majority residing in developing nations (UN., 2023). In low-income countries, internet usage is significantly lower compared to high-income countries, where over 90% of the population is online. For example, in the least developed countries, only about 36% of the population uses the internet, compared to a global average of 66%. This lack of connectivity limits access to telemedicine, online education, and remote work opportunities, which also heightens existing socioeconomic inequalities. Energy access is a fundamental enabler of digital connectivity. Without reliable electricity, operating the infrastructure required for internet services like cell towers, routers, and data centers is challenging. At the same time, digital technologies can improve energy accessibility. Leveraging mobile technology for energy services, such as mobile money platforms for pay-as-you-go solar systems, has enabled millions to afford and manage renewable energy solutions. Addressing the intertwined challenges of energy poverty and the digital divide requires coordinated strategies. Investments in renewable energy infrastructure can power digital expansion, while digital tools can optimize energy distribution and consumption. Addressing both issues jointly can help foster inclusive growth and ensure that underserved communities benefit from modern technologies."
