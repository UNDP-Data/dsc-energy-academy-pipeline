It makes it more likely that policies and interventions are tailored to the various needs and challenges faced by diverse communities, fostering inclusivity and promoting equitable outcomes. Key benefits include (but are not limited to): Addressing root causes. By understanding the specific challenges faced by different groups, interventions can be designed to address the root causes of energy poverty, whether they stem from gender-based roles, geographic constraints, socioeconomic disparities or other factors. Community engagement. An intersectional approach encourages active engagement with communities, allowing for the co-creation of solutions that respect local cultures, values, and social dynamics. This collaboration enhances the sustainability and social acceptance of energy projects and gives them greater political legitimacy. Maximizing impact. Considering the interconnected nature of social identities ensures that interventions have a broader impact, reaching and benefiting a more diverse range of individuals. This approach contributes to the achievement of broader sustainable development goals. Reducing vulnerabilities. An intersectional approach addresses the compounded challenges faced by marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities and displaced populations, who are often excluded from sustainable energy services. By tackling systemic barriers like discrimination and limited access to resources, tailored interventions enhance resilience and ensure energy initiatives foster inclusivity and social protection."

By adopting an intersectional lens, the project acknowledges the compounded vulnerabilities faced by women in marginalized communities and harnesses their unique potential to drive inclusive, sustainable change. Women are trained as energy auditors, helping households adopt energy-efficient lighting, fans, and cooling devices, thereby reducing costs and improving energy affordability and availability. Women emerge as grassroots micro-entrepreneurs, establishing women-led distribution networks for efficient and off-grid energy products. This creates opportunities for economic independence and strengthens their decision-making power in household energy use. The initiative goes beyond product adoption by educating women and their communities on interpreting electricity bills, calculating energy consumption, identifying sources of energy wastage, and implementing passive cooling solutions like white roofs and ModRoofs, modular roofing systems made from recylced materials that provide better insulation and can lower indoor temperatures by up to 6°C."

Over 28,000 energy audits have been conducted in slum communities, leading to annual electricity savings of more than USD 700,000 for families. The project has facilitated the installation of 200 modular roofs and 500 roofs with solar-reflective paint, collectively reducing carbon emissions by approximately 105 tons of CO₂ equivalent annually. One exemplary aspect of the project is its integration of women into various facets of climate resilience. From becoming energy auditors to forming Community Action Groups (CAG) and acting as leaders or Vikasinis, women play multifaceted roles. These Vikasinis participate in stakeholder meetings with local authorities, institutes, and society members, effectively addressing local issues and influencing positive change. The transformative impact of the Climate Saathis project is evident in real-life examples. Houses once enduring temperatures reaching up to 50 degrees Celsius have now adopted cooling roofs made from sustainable materials, drastically reducing indoor temperatures. These tangible changes have improved living conditions, enhanced health, and even provided a platform for income-generating activities, such as home-run businesses. The project’s innovative and community-driven approach earned Mahila Housing Trust the 2019 United Nations Global Climate Action Award at the UN climate change conference. This acknowledgment highlights the importance of integrating intersectional and gender perspectives into sustainable energy access strategies and into climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts."
