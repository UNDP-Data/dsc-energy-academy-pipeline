However, ensuring sustainable energy access requires that energy services meet critical requirements: affordability, availability, safety, reliability, and adequacy. all linked to the sustainability of energy. When energy is out of reach or unreliable, communities suffer, opportunities are lost, and progress stalls. In contrast, when these requirements are met, energy can drive multiple facets of development. In Lesson 2, you will gain insight into the building blocks of sustainable energy access and explore the various development outcomes it can support."

This program has been successfully implemented in multiple countries across different regions. The Initiative grounded in the belief that access to reliable, clean energy is a critical enabler of quality healthcare, particularly in crisis-affected and underserved areas like Yemen. Its theory of change centers on improving health outcomes and strengthening resilience by electrifying health facilities with solar power. The approach includes the procurement and installation of solar photovoltaic systems tailored to the energy needs of different tiers of health facilities. Solar for Health promotes community engagement through volunteer committees for system upkeep and supports policy frameworks that enable the long-term scaling of clean energy in health systems. Its financial model ensures long-term sustainability through coordinated, blended financing, bringing together governments, donors, energy service providers (ESP), and development finance institutions (DFI) to align efforts and avoid fragmented investments. Public-private partnerships enable ESPs to access DFI financing, supported by mechanisms like donor-backed payments and credit guarantees to reduce financial risk, while power purchase agreements (PPAs) between governments and ESPs provide stable revenue streams. Since 2017, this initiative has brought several beneficial outcomes to Yemeni communities: 27 healthcare facilities across Yemen have been provided with solar micro-grids and solar-power refrigerators, bringing positive impacts to 208,000 people and enabling vaccination to almost 70 children. In Al-Za’zea catchment area, the medical services provide care for over 5,000 people and increases the number of patients the healthcare facility can receive, including up to 175 visits per month by local women looking for family planning services, pregnancy care, and treatment for malnourished children. Not only does the initiative benefit the communities by providing access to electricity, it also provides dozens of workers with new skills and qualifications in sustainable energy technologies jobs."

UNDP has also supported the assessment of innovative financing mechanisms to scale this program in Malawi, Zimbabwe, Liberia, Namibia, and Zambia. The coordination platform financing model is scalable across geographies with specific features that can be tailored to local specificities. The platform can harmonize stakeholders’ interventions, such as UN agencies, donors, DFIs, private sector, and government entities, across countries in linking energy and health sectors. Furthermore, the financial model behind Solar for Health is designed to ensure the long-term financial and operational sustainability of solar installations through a coordinated approach. The Solar for Health Coordination Platform aligns donors, governments, private energy service providers (ESPs), and development finance institutions (DFIs) to avoid fragmentation and inefficiencies. To attract private investment and scale impact, the model aggregates projects into investment portfolios with appropriate risk-return profiles, enabling ESPs to access DFI funding through public-private partnerships (PPPs). These partnerships are structured to ensure predictable cash flows—supported by donor contributions and guarantees—which help reduce financial risks. Technical assistance mechanisms complement the financing model by building the capacity of local stakeholders and structuring power purchase agreements (PPAs). This integrated financing approach reduces upfront costs for governments while ensuring long-term service delivery, energy reliability, and resilience across the health sector.
