              "text": "To expand sustainable and inclusive energy access it si essential to have the right business models and financing strategies that can reach the underserved, attract investment, and ensure long-term affordability. This lesson explores how tailored financial instruments and delivery models are transforming the energy access landscape, especially in remote, rural, and low-income communities. There are a wide range of financing mechanisms related to increasing access to energy - such as funds, bonds, debt swaps, carbon finance initiatives, among others. Describing all such mechanisms is not the purpose of this lesson - they are covered in Module 4 - Sustainable Energy Finance and Investment. From results-based financing that rewards energy providers for delivering measurable outcomes, to Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) models that remove the barrier of upfront costs, innovative approaches are helping scale decentralized renewable energy solutions. At the same time, end-user-focused tools like pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems and green microfinance are enabling households and small businesses to access and afford clean energy services on flexible terms. Finally, this lesson also highlights the importance of community-led initiatives and participatory design processes. These approaches not only ensure energy solutions are tailored to local needs, but also promote ownership, resilience, and long-term impact"

These mechanisms enable the implementation of clean energy initiatives and ensure that energy providers can operate efficiently and expand their reach, ultimately bringing energy access to a broader populace. Financial mechanisms for energy service providers typically require considerable investments and recurring costs for the state budget. Many developing countries struggle to combine fiscal and environmental sustainability, while also expanding access to energy. Therefore, innovative partnerships forged among governments, financial institutions, the private sector and development agencies can play a pivotal role in supporting the expansion of energy access and scaling up clean energy projects, particularly in regions with limited access to capital. Such partnerships can make upfront costs more manageable, reduce long-term operational costs, and also be designed to contribute to environmental sustainability."

These models tie financial incentives to the achievement of defined energy access goals. In essence, they reward successful expansion of energy services to those who need it most. RBF has proven to be an effective strategy in catalyzing the expansion of energy access and accelerating the transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. According to SEforALL, RBF is \"proven to deliver connections faster and more efficiently. Governments and donors offer grants to project developers that are paid upon delivery of energy connections. Thus the risks of delivery are shifted to the private sector while companies are incentivized to build at speed and scale\" (source: SEforAll Results-Based Financing). RBF is a strategic approach that shifts the focus from merely funding projects and initiatives to achieving defined outcomes. It operates on the principle of paying for results achieved and performance against pre-established targets. This results-oriented approach is particularly valuable in energy projects because it provides a direct link between funding and the impact on beneficiaries."

              "text": "One of the core principles of RBF is incentivizing energy service providers to reach underserved populations and attain energy access goals. These incentives can be financial rewards, grants, or subsidies, often tied to specific performance indicators. For instance, energy providers may receive payments upon successfully connecting a certain number of households to the grid or installing a specific capacity of renewable energy infrastructure. Nevertheless, it is often suggested to select targets closer to outcomes than to outputs, to reduce the risk of disincentivizing and/or neglecting key dimensions of a program. RBF models have the potential to significantly scale up energy access projects, particularly in underserved regions. By linking payments to results, governments and development organizations motivate energy providers to expand their operations in areas that are traditionally considered financially unattractive, such as remote rural communities. Project implementers are required to demonstrate the achievement of specific milestones or targets. This not only ensures that funds are used effectively but also enhances the trust and credibility of energy access projects, which can be especially crucial in attracting additional investments. While Results-Based Financing models offer numerous advantages, they are not without challenges. Setting realistic and measurable targets can be complex, and verification processes must be rigorous. Moreover, RBF models require strong governance and financial systems to manage the disbursement of incentives effectively."

              "text": "Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) is an business model that shifts the traditional energy supply model from selling electricity by the kilowatt-hour to providing tailored energy services. Instead of purchasing energy infrastructure directly, customers pay for services such as lighting, cooling, or productive energy use through subscription or performance-based contracts (IRENA., 2020). . This approach can be particularly impactful in developing countries, where upfront costs and financing barriers prevent many households and institutions from accessing clean, reliable electricity. For instance, EaaS enables off-grid customers to access distributed renewable energy solutions like solar PV and battery storage without the need to purchase them upfront, thereby accelerating access to modern energy services. In the EaaS model, Energy Service Providers (ESPs) offer bundled services, including the design, installation, financing, and operation of energy systems. For example, ESPs can install solar home systems or mini-grids in rural communities and manage the systems remotely using smart technologies. These models can educe high entry costs for consumers and provide a reliable, affordable alternative to diesel generators or grid expansion. In India for instance, the National Smart Grid Mission is deploying 250 million smart meters to enable dynamic pricing and service contracts that improve energy reliability for underserved populations (Government of India, 2020) EaaS can also support the deployment of decentralized renewable energy systems which are crucial for rural electrification in developing regions. In South Africa, for example, pilot-scale smart grid projects backed by the South African National Energy Development Initiative used EaaS models to enhance access and reduce peak demand (Smart Energy International., 2017). These models also help public institutions: hospitals and schools can subscribe to solar-as-a-service contracts that ensure reliable electricity without needing to operate or maintain the equipment themselves."

              "text": "EaaS providers can also use smart meters, load management tools, and AI-based controls to help consumers manage their electricity use more efficiently, for instance by reducing consumption when electricity prices are highest. This approach, known as demand-side management, can lower peak electricity demand by 3â€“10% and reduce overall energy costs for low-income households and small businesses. In developing countries, many EaaS providers also rely on mobile platforms to share real-time energy use and pricing information with customers, with the potential to make energy services more accessible and user-friendly. EaaS may also create opportunities for local entrepreneurship. Rural energy cooperatives and small enterprises can act as service providers under franchised or licensed EaaS models. The company Husk Power Systems is an example of the Energy-as-a-Service model as it designs, owns, and operates renewable energy mini-grids that deliver reliable electricity to rural communities in India and Nigeria. As of January 2025, Husk operates over 400 mini-grids, providing power to more than 1.5 million people and over 30,000 small businesses ( Solar Quarter., 2025). These mini-grids integrate solar photovoltaic and biomass gasification technologies, ensuring a continuous 24/7 power supply. Customers access electricity through flexible, pay-as-you-go plans facilitated by mobile-enabled smart meters. This approach also fosters economic growth by enabling businesses to operate more efficiently and creating local employment opportunities."

Among these models, green microfinance stands out for its dual role in advancing inclusive development and environmental sustainability. Green microfinance refers to financial servicesâ€”such as microloans, revolving funds, or credit schemesâ€”specifically tailored to enable low-income households and small enterprises to invest in clean energy, climate adaptation technologies, and sustainable livelihood practices. These schemes often include tiered pricing structures and flexible repayment models, allowing recipients to repay loans in small increments based on their income flows. An example fo such initiative is the EcoMicro programme in Latin America which is building the capacity of 12 microfinance institutions to design financial products for clean energy and energy efficiency (UNFCCC., 2023). In Mexico and Peru, EcoMicro is expected to mobilize USD 5.9 million in green finance for over 5,000 small businesses, enabling them to reduce emissions by up to 20%. Similarly, the UNDP-supported Small Grants Programme (SGP) has enabled micro-credit schemes in Costa Rica and Vietnam to support sustainable agriculture and solar-powered fish sauce production (UNDP., 2022) . Through this program, in Ghana, a village savings and credit scheme tied to eco-charcoal production has generated income for 1,800 farmers while reducing noxious emissions by 70%."

When designed thoughtfully, it can address barriers to energy access, support climate resilience, and empower communities to invest in solutions that improve their well-being. If not well-designed, however, microfinancing schemes may present problems for end users. To avoid potential pitfalls, it is very important to: Ensure products and schemes actively include women by offering products tailored to their needs and engaging local womenâ€™s groups in program design and implementation. Establish fair loan terms with flexible, income-based repayment options to avoid overburdening families and excluding the poorest households. Guide users toward reliable technology by providing clear information and quality standards, reducing the risk of low-cost, unreliable choices. It's important to remember that energy needs extend beyond the household level. Farming communities, entrepreneurs, and various other groups may possess specific and unique requirements that necessitate tailored financial programs. Many such communities take the lead in devising their own energy access solutions, requiring a different form of support and financial solutions to empower their self-sufficiency and resilience. The acknowledgment of this diversity in energy access needs and community-driven initiatives is paramount in achieving an equitable and all-encompassing approach to energy access."

However, further innovative approaches are required to accelerate electrification and the integration of renewable energy solutions in SIDS. In response, Vanuatu is seizing renewable energy to expand access, currently available to only 33% of its population. In September 2020, the communities of Wintua and Lorlow inaugurated a community-owned solar micro-grid.This local management structure helps keep electricity costs low by avoiding external operation costs. In addition, these communities have set up an energy cooperative in partnership with the Department of Cooperatives to manage the collection of electricity fees."
