Energy planning that is implemented in a gender-neutral way misses important issues and inadvertently discriminates, usually against women. For example, a policy to promote the use of electricity by small enterprises may neglect the fact that many of women’s income-generating activities use process heat (such as for food preparation and processing, beer brewing, and pottery making), for which electricity may not be the cheapest option. 2. Promote a gender-mainstreaming approach. An engendered energy policy would recognise that women and men have different energy needs due to their differing household roles, responses to crises, and coping mechanisms and would offer energy technologies and services that match those needs."

The actual process of policy formulation and implementation needs to be engendered. Increased participation of women in the energy sector and improvement of their status relative to men can help to incorporate gender as an integral part of energy policies and practices. 4. Collect and use disaggregated data. In each step of the policy process, policymakers should specifically address how their decisions will differently impact various population subgroups. This requires use of data sets disaggregated by sex and other social and economic variables to determine who is using what forms of energy to do what."

However, budgetary allocations have the power to transform gender inequalities. One approach to ensuring that the needs of women as well as men are met is for government budgets to be gender disaggregated. Gender budgeting is a tool that can be used to break down and identify the differentiated impacts of public revenue allocations and expenditures as they affect men and women. 6. Define the elements of gender-sensitive energy policies and advocate for gender-sensitivity in the energy policy-making processes. Like any sectoral policy, energy policy has a multidimensional character: it contains political, economic, environmental, and social elements. Each of these elements has a gender dimension. The four general aspects of energy policy listed above need to be correlated with three issues that lie at the heart of women’s energy needs: availability, affordability, and safety. There are a number of different, sometimes overlapping, rationales for incorporating gender sensitivity into energy policies, and different stakeholders may be more or less responsive to different arguments and viewpoints."

Engaging indigenous communities in energy governance ensures that decisions are open, democratic and respect the human rights of all communities, while making good use of indigenous knowledge and civic participation in the decision-making process. Creating an enabling environment for the inclusion of indigenous communities in energy policy must follow a set of principal actions: Policy advocacy to incorporate issues relevant to indigenous people in all levels of policymaking, through building capacities and partnerships with indigenous peoples and organizations. Transparent and participatory processes in energy policymaking, aimed at inclusion and empowerment. Focus on action-oriented research that involves the relevant constituencies, policy reform, information, coordination and direct involvement of indigenous peoples, through a valorization and protection of indigenous knowledge. Capacity-building of indigenous peoples and organizations to build their institutions at the local level, and support and strengthen indigenous networks, at local, national and international levels."
