Decisions regarding the energy mix—such as the types of energy sources prioritized, the development of specific projects, and the distribution of resources—have profound governance implications. These decisions influence how energy is produced and consumed, and they involve a diverse array of stakeholders. The outcomes and beneficiaries of such decisions are shaped by the governance structures in place, whether on a global, national, provincial, community, or household scale."

It comprises the mechanisms, policies, processes, and institutions through which governments, people, communities, and corporations articulate their interests, exercise their legal rights, meet their obligations, and mediate their differences in relation to energy (UNDP, 2023)."

              "text": "The world today faces an unprecedented challenge: the climate crisis, driven primarily by fossil fuel consumption. This challenge is reshaping economies, ecosystems, and societies. At the same time, energy poverty remains widespread, with 685 million people lacking electricity access and 2.1 billion people without clean cooking facilities, the majority of whom live in Sub-Saharan Africa. Governing energy systems has always been a fundamental effort of political societies, traditionally balancing security and affordability. However, the climate crisis has introduced a third critical dimension—sustainability—transforming the mandate of energy regulators and reshaping energy governance. This shift is unfolding amid deep global inequalities and increasing instability. For the first time in over 30 years, the Human Development Index (HDI) declined for two consecutive years, 2020 and 2021, erasing gains from the previous five years. This decline is attributed to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which have exacerbated poverty and inequality. Concurrently, many societies are experiencing heightened political and social polarization."

A just energy transition must not only be environmentally sustainable but also socially inclusive, economically viable, and politically stable. However, despite growing global commitments to clean energy transitions, many countries lack the necessary governance structures to navigate the trade-offs and challenges involved. Weak institutional coordination, regulatory gaps, limited civic participation, and financial barriers can all slow down or derail just energy transitions, deepening existing inequalities instead of addressing them. In the coming lessons, we will delve deeper into the key components and principles of effective and inclusive energy governance."

While countries’ experiences with energy transition highlight a plethora of technological solutions for decarbonizing societies, the predominant challenge often lies in the governance aspects tied to these transitions. Effective energy governance requires a purpose-driven, risk-informed, and people-responsive approach that strives to achieve multiple objectives: ensuring energy availability and affordability reducing carbon emissions promoting equity, and managing risks and uncertainties. By optimizing across these dimensions, governance systems can maximize the positive outcomes of the energy transition."
