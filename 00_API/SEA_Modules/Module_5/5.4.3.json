The traditional “regulate and forget” mindset must give way to “adapt-and-learn” approaches. The capability to detect and understand innovations and their potential impact on existing regulations, or, more important, the public values that are at stake, is key. Addressing any “pacing problem” requires shortening timeframes throughout the policymaking process and using regulatory management tools in a more dynamic, adaptive, and iterative manner. Putting in place mechanisms for public and stakeholder engagement, including citizens and small innovative enterprises, from an early stage and throughout the policy cycle to enhance transparency, build trust and capitalize on various sources of expertise. Considering the international innovation ecosystem to draw on the most relevant evidence and regulatory approaches, as the most transformative innovations cut across jurisdictional boundaries and, therefore, will inevitably face several jurisdictions concurrently"

Non-binding standards, by being easier to adopt and offering more flexibility in implementation, can help address the regulatory challenges raised by innovation. Enabling greater experimentation, testing, and trialling to stimulate innovation under regulatory supervision. Given the speed, breadth and uncertainty characterising innovation, creating space for experimentation to support innovation while also fostering policy learning and adaptation is essential. Adapting regulatory enforcement strategies and activities to promote compliance, help innovators navigate the regulatory environment and uphold public protection, including across jurisdictions."
