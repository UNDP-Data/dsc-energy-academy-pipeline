In the energy sector, one of the most significant market failures is the inability of current markets to internalize negative externalities—such as greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation—into the final price paid by consumers. This failure allows fossil fuel industries to remain artificially competitive because their environmental and social costs are not reflected in market prices. As a result, renewable and low-carbon alternatives—such as green hydrogen—face an unfair disadvantage despite their long-term sustainability benefits."

Tools such as carbon taxes and carbon markets aim to correct these failures by putting a price on carbon emissions, thereby incentivizing cleaner alternatives and making the playing field more equitable. In addition to market failures, investment challenges hinder the growth of renewable energy. These include high upfront capital costs, perceived financial risks, and limited access to affordable financing, particularly in developing countries where institutional and financial infrastructures may be weaker. Addressing these barriers requires de-risking strategies, policy guarantees, and innovative financing mechanisms to attract private investment and enable an equitable energy transition."

Systems of rules like constitutions or trade treaties establish limits on behaviour. Not all rule systems are formally encoded as law. Informal institutions serve the same purpose and should not be seen as weak or irrelevant. Indeed, in many developing contexts, informal rules that relate to things like kinship or patronage politics can matter more than formal rules written into law. Whether informal or formalized through laws and policies, gender relations are also systems that shape and/or constrain behaviour of individuals as well as of institutions."
