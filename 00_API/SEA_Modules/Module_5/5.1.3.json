The proportion of such NDCs is even lower among developing countries, where the risks of social disruption, energy poverty, and exclusion are often more acute. Furthermore, the UNFCCC’s 2023 synthesis report found that only 31 percent of Parties explicitly address the unequal impacts of climate measures on workers and vulnerable groups."

The first Global Stocktake concluded in 2023 and provided critical insights into the global state of climate ambition. Among its most striking findings was the persistent gap between current nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the emissions pathways consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.
