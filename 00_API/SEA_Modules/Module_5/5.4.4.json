To understand these challenges more systematically, the UNDP applied a conceptual governance framework to assess Nigeria’s energy transition. Before diving into the specific governance issues, we first explore the elements of this framework."

The most frequently discussed challenge was Political Vision & Commitment, with stakeholders highlighting institutional fragmentation, weak policy coordination, and short-term political decision-making as major barriers. Legal and regulatory inconsistencies—such as conflicting fossil fuel and renewable energy policies—also emerged as significant concerns. Civic engagement and transparency remain weak, with minimal inclusion of local communities, women, and marginalized groups in shaping Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan (ETP). Stakeholders also noted power imbalances in land ownership and resource control, which could impact equitable access to energy transition benefits. Financial governance was less discussed, but concerns were raised about rushed investments in critical minerals, lack of transparency in climate finance, and limited awareness of carbon markets.
