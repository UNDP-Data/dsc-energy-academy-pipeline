              "text": "This involves actors such as regulatory bodies, parliamentary committees, and independent watchdog organizations, each playing distinct roles in ensuring transparency and accountability in the energy sector. Regulatory oversight focuses on enforcing compliance with energy laws and standards. Regulatory authorities may monitor market behavior, set tariffs, ensure fair competition, and protect consumer rights. For example, an energy regulator might investigate market abuses or mandate service quality standards, using various tools—including audits—as part of its enforcement strategy. In parallel, external and independent audits serve as important instruments to verify financial and operational integrity. These audits, which may be conducted by independent bodies or mandated by regulators, assess whether energy companies are complying with legal and financial obligations. For instance, audits of distribution companies can uncover fraudulent practices such as “shadow employment” or misreporting of losses. While audits are sometimes initiated by regulators, they are distinct from regulatory powers and serve as a complementary accountability mechanism. Finally, parliamentary committees or civil society watchdogs may conduct additional oversight—examining whether energy policies are being implemented as intended, whether public funds are used efficiently, and whether reforms are delivering on equity and access goals."

The methodology analyzes areas such as energy planning, budgets, institutional capacity for gender mainstreaming, and the integration of gender into energy and broader national development objectives. The audits identify critical gender gaps in policy formulation and implementation, examining how gender issues are addressed by institutions and policies Key steps include data collection (desk reviews, interviews, and focus group discussions), which inform a roadmap to enhance gender capacity, assess energy policies, and develop a gender action plan (GAP). A participatory validation workshop finalizes the process, setting specific targets and timeframes for gender integration and securing the Ministry’s commitment to the findings."
