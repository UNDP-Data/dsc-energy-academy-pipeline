Rather than relying solely on hierarchical control, modern energy governance is characterized by collaborative networks that span multiple levels—international, national, regional, and local—and engage a diverse range of actors, including governments, regulatory bodies, private sector entities, civil society, and local communities. Unlike traditional top-down policy implementation, the governance model operates through continuous negotiation and coordination across various sectors and levels. This shift enhances policy adaptability, strengthens accountability mechanisms, and ensures that energy transitions are inclusive, transparent, and responsive to societal needs."

Globalization of Energy Markets: Energy markets are no longer confined within national borders; they are increasingly shaped by international trade, cross-border investments, and global supply chains. This globalization of energy markets has profound implications for energy governance, as decision-making is influenced not just by national policies but also by international agreements, multinational corporations, and financial institutions. Technological Innovation and Market Liberalization: The rise of distributed energy resources, digitalization, and clean energy transitions has disrupted traditional governance structures, requiring more dynamic regulatory frameworks. Increased Role of Civil Society and Non-State Actors: NGOs, advocacy groups, and local communities are now key players in shaping policy and holding governments accountable for sustainable and equitable energy transitions"

Regulation: Setting rules for the market to ensure competition, innovation, and fairness. Investment: Helping to mobilize capital needed for the energy transition, perhaps through ownership or fiscal policies in support of relevant enterprises and infrastructure development, and provision of appropriate financial support fora just energy transition for individuals and communities.
