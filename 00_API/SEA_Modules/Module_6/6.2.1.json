The emissions from solar and wind energy are much lower than those from coal and natural gas.

A 2022 study recalculated the SCC at $185 per ton of CO2, significantly higher than previous estimates. This figure was determined using updated climate-economic models that factor in more severe and long-term effects of climate change.

These pollutants are linked to various health problems, including respiratory diseases and heart conditions. For example, natural gas combustion produces an average of 7.6 pounds of particulate matter emissions and 0.6 pounds of sulfur dioxide emissions per million standard cubic feet of natural gas combusted. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that outdoor air pollution causes around 4.2 million premature deaths annually, primarily from diseases such as stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory infections. In contrast, renewable energy systems generate virtually no air pollution during operation, with emissions occurring mainly during their construction, manufacturing, and transportation."

Fossil fuel power plants were responsible for a large portion of this water use. Coal plants alone withdrew 189.6 billion cubic meters of water. In contrast, renewable energy technologies used just 12.1 billion cubic meters in 2021. As such, solar panels and wind turbines do not require water for cooling or steam production, using it only for cleaning and construction, significantly reducing overall water consumption. However, geothermal energy does require water as a heat transfer fluid in the form of steam or hot water to generate electricity or provide direct heating, making its water use higher than other renewables."
