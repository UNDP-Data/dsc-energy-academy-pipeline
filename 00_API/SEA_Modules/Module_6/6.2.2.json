In 2023, solar PV accounted for three-quarters of all renewable power capacity additions, with global capacity reaching a record 473 gigawatts. CSP, on the other hand, uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight, generating heat for power production, and it can store energy for use at night.

              "text": "Wind power harnesses the kinetic energy of the wind through turbines that convert it into electrical energy, producing minimal greenhouse gas emissions compared to other energy sources. Over the past decade, wind technology has seen significant innovations, improving efficiency, power, and capacity while reducing noise. Wind installations now include onshore, offshore, and floating platforms capable of withstanding extreme conditions, such as hurricane-force winds. Offshore wind, with its stronger and more consistent winds, is expected to grow as siting challenges are addressed. Wind power currently accounts for 6-7% of global electricity, with substantial potential to meet global energy needs. Wind energy is a crucial component of global climate strategies, particularly under the IEA Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario, as emphasized in the UAE Consensus, which calls for doubling energy efficiency and tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030. In 2022, wind power grew by 17%, contributing to a combined 12% share of global electricity generation alongside solar PV. Wind energy's near-zero greenhouse gas emissions and high energy return on energy invested (EROEI) make it an essential solution for reducing emissions. Additionally, wind power supports job creation, particularly in China and Europe, with 1.4 million jobs in 2022. Wind turbines have an operational lifespan of 20 years, running nearly emissions-free after offsetting construction emissions within 3-6 months."

This ambitious project aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while tapping into the country's substantial wind energy potential, estimated at 929 billion kWh annually, equivalent to 154 GW of installed capacity. By the time the project concluded in 2011, it had laid critical groundwork for wind energy development, addressing systemic barriers and fostering a more favorable environment for renewable energy investment. At the outset, the project faced significant obstacles. Awareness of wind energy’s potential was minimal, and technical capacity within the country was underdeveloped. There were no operational wind farms to provide a proof of concept, and financial barriers loomed large, including low electricity tariffs, high commercial risks, and challenges in securing both domestic and foreign investment. Institutional barriers further hindered progress, with an absence of dedicated policies, regulatory frameworks, and centralized mechanisms to promote and manage wind energy projects."

The initiative also fostered capacity-building through training programs, enabling local professionals to acquire expertise in wind energy technologies, resource assessment, and project planning. Over 100 professionals were trained, and specialized software tools were introduced to streamline project development processes. Significant progress was also made in engaging stakeholders, from government agencies to private investors. The establishment of partnerships with international and national organizations laid the foundation for ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing.

It can be categorized into different types, including storage dams and “run-of-river” systems. Large storage dams provide backup power and rapid response during outages, while run-of-river plants offer continuous base load energy. Hydropower is highly valuable for grid stability, providing fast-response generation and supporting frequency stability. However, its potential is influenced by climate-related changes in rainfall and ecosystems, with droughts posing a challenge. Hydropower offers substantial carbon emissions reductions, saving up to 4 billion tonnes of CO2 annually compared to coal. It accounts for about 9% of global CO2 emissions reduction. In the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario, hydropower continues to grow at an average rate of 4% annually. There remains considerable untapped potential for hydropower development. Global technical potential is estimated at 14,576 TWh/year, over four times current generation levels. Africa, in particular, holds vast undeveloped potential, offering significant opportunities for growth."

It offers sustainable production and generates cost-effective, dispatchable power, unaffected by climate conditions. Geothermal energy has lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional base-load thermal generation. In off-peak periods, it can also help recharge battery-powered vehicles, further reducing CO2 emissions. Geothermal energy can become a key part of future electricity and heating systems, offering a clean and reliable energy source.

Advancements in technology and reductions in project costs could enable the deployment of up to 800 gigawatts (GW) of geothermal capacity worldwide, generating nearly 6,000 terawatt-hours annually—equivalent to the current combined electricity consumption of the United States and India. A notable advantage of geothermal power is its ability to provide continuous, baseload electricity. Geothermal plants can operate at full capacity 24/7, offering a reliable energy source. In 2023, global geothermal capacity had a utilization rate exceeding 75%, significantly higher than wind power's less than 30% and solar photovoltaic's (PV) less than 15%. Additionally, geothermal plants can operate flexibly, aiding in grid stabilization and complementing intermittent renewable sources like solar PV and wind. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that, with appropriate support, costs for next-generation geothermal technologies could decrease by 80% by 2035. At this cost level, geothermal plants could produce electricity at approximately $50 per megawatt-hour (MWh), positioning them among the most affordable dispatchable low-emission electricity sources, comparable to or cheaper than hydro, nuclear, and bioenergy. Furthermore, geothermal energy would be highly competitive with solar and wind power when paired with battery storage."

This hinders progress and accurate assessments of how geothermal energy is operating and performing. This leads to ambiguity in reporting and a limited understanding of what needs to be done differently. Cost and technology: High-grade geothermal resources have restricted geographic distribution. There are cost and technological hurdles to using low-grade geothermal resources and EGS. The levelized cost of geothermal energy has increased 36% from 2010-2021, more than any other energy source examined in that research. High-quality geothermal resources are already economically competitive with market energy costs in many areas. Public and private research funding and favorable deployment rules may be required to develop and commercialize lower-grade hydrothermal deposits. The effectiveness of these efforts may play an important role in determining the magnitude of geothermal energy's contributions to long-term GHG emissions reductions."
