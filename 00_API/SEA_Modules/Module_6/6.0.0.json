              "text": "This module examines the critical relationship between energy systems and climate change, underscoring the urgent need for a global shift toward sustainable energy. With the energy sector responsible for approximately 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the module highlights the significant carbon footprint of energy production and consumption. It explores the pressing challenges posed by climate change and the imperative to transition to zero-carbon and renewable energy sources to mitigate these impacts. The module also addresses the vulnerability of energy infrastructure to climate-related risks, such as extreme weather events and rising temperatures. It advocates for adaptive measures, including the development of resilient grid systems and the integration of distributed energy resources to complement traditional centralized infrastructure. Finally, the module emphasizes the transformative role of renewable energy in enhancing climate resilience. Through real-world examples, it showcases how renewable energy solutions can be successfully integrated into disaster preparedness and response, ensuring a more sustainable and secure energy future."
