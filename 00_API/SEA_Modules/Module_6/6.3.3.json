An intersectional approach to climate change recognizes that the impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed and that vulnerable populations often bear the brunt of its consequences. Energy systems are central to this dynamic, as access to reliable and affordable energy can determine a community’s ability to adapt and thrive in a changing climate. Climate change can exacerbate energy inequities, disproportionately affecting marginalized groups based on income, geography, gender, or other social factors. This lesson explores how sustainable energy solutions can be designed and implemented in a way that addresses these intersecting challenges, ensuring that climate adaptation strategies are equitable, inclusive, and effective."

Similarly, environmental degradation can exacerbate gender-based violence, as resource scarcity and displacement increase tensions and insecurity. In conflict zones and refugee camps, women who must leave their communities to gather firewood for cooking or heating face an increased risk of violence, including assault and exploitation. On the other hand, empowering women and marginalized groups economically, socially, and politically can drive more effective climate action and environmental conservation (OECD, 2023)"

Additionally, women account for a significant proportion of the over 4 million annual deaths caused by indoor air pollution, as they are more likely to rely on unsafe cooking fuels (UNFCCC, 2022)."

              "text": "As the impact of climate change intensifies, a just and equitable transition to a low-carbon economy is crucial for meeting the Paris Agreement’s climate goals. If not managed well, this transition could lead to increased social inequality, exclusion, civil unrest, and decreased business competitiveness. To counter these risks, many countries are incorporating just transition principles into their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Long-Term Strategies (LTS). Currently, 38% of NDCs and 56% of LTS reflect these principles, with the support of various global initiatives. The creation of a dedicated Just Transition Work Programme at COP28 in Dubai marked a significant step forward in this endeavor. This is important because clear signposting of comprehensive climate policy frameworks that consider the implications of a just transition can guide financial actors in translating them into a pipeline of viable or investment-ready projects. An intersectional approach to climate change must go beyond surface-level solutions and tackle the root causes of inequality. This means addressing the systemic drivers of differential vulnerabilities, such as racial and gender inequities, while also centering the politics and ethics of care in adaptation planning. It requires adopting place-based and place-making approaches that respect the unique contexts and needs of communities, as well as fostering cross-identity forms of activism and resilience-building."

While national policies and large-scale investments set the foundation for energy transition, it is equally crucial to engage affected communities at every stage of development. Participatory models that empower marginalized groups to co-design solutions ensure that energy projects reflect lived experiences, cultural values, and environmental realities. For instance, Indigenous communities have long-standing sustainable energy practices that can inform the placement and operation of renewable energy projects, ensuring they align with local ecosystems while mitigating climate risks such as floods, droughts, and extreme temperatures. A balanced approach that combines institutional expertise with community-driven insights leads to more effective, inclusive, and resilient energy systems."

Afar pastoralists in Ethiopia rely on observations of stars, wind patterns, and plant behaviors to anticipate droughts and shifting seasons—insights that could inform energy infrastructure planning and renewable resource management. (Alemayehu & Hizekeal, 2022) Nenets reindeer herders in Arctic Russia monitor ice thickness and seasonal changes to adapt migration routes, knowledge that could be leveraged to optimize renewable energy storage and distribution in extreme environments (UNESCO, 2016). Rather than relying solely on external climate models, integrating these forecasting methods with modern meteorological data could improve the reliability of early warning systems, ensuring energy networks remain resilient in the face of increasing climate variability."

              "text": "Water management is another area where Indigenous knowledge can significantly strengthen energy adaptation efforts. In the Peruvian Andes, Quechua communities have maintained ancient water-harvesting systems such as amunas, which are pre-Incan infiltration canals designed to capture and slow the flow of glacier meltwater, thereby replenishing aquifers. The amunas function by diverting seasonal water from mountain streams into infiltration basins, allowing it to seep into the ground and sustain aquifers over time. This traditional method not only mitigates the impact of climate change on water availability but also promotes biodiversity by reducing the need for new dams. (Nature, 2024) In Australia, Aboriginal fire management practices—often referred to as \"right way fire\"—integrate traditional ecological knowledge with modern scientific methods to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from unmanaged wildfires. These practices involve the strategic use of \"cool burns\" during the early dry season, which reduce fuel loads and create firebreaks, thereby preventing the occurrence of large, uncontrolled wildfires that typically release significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. (UNESCO, 2016) These examples demonstrate that Indigenous land and water management strategies are not relics of the past but dynamic, place-based solutions that can enhance energy resilience when applied in a meaningful and collaborative way."

In Canada, the Qulliq Energy Corporation (QEC) oversees the management of off-grid solar and wind systems that integrate Indigenous governance principles with microgrid technology. This approach aims to reduce reliance on diesel fuel while promoting energy sovereignty for Inuit communities in Nunavut. However, ensuring that Indigenous communities are at the center of energy transitions requires more than technical integration—it demands structural changes in policy and governance. Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) must go beyond being a procedural requirement and instead become a framework for Indigenous-led decision-making in renewable energy projects."

Scaling these approaches requires a commitment to Indigenous data sovereignty, ensuring that environmental and climate data are collected, interpreted, and shared in ways that respect Indigenous governance structures. It also means shifting international climate finance mechanisms to prioritize direct funding for Indigenous-led energy and adaptation projects rather than channeling resources through top-down interventions that bypass local leadership."

While widely distributed to households, small solar photovoltaic lighting systems provide only limited energy access. Affordable parts for repairs are not available. Larger systems such as solar photovoltaic mini-grids have addressed institutional needs, mainly boarding schools but lack financial and technical sustainability. Imported energy efficient cook stoves have seen limited adoption due to high costs and lack of awareness. Launched in 2020 by UNDP, the GEF-funded POIDIER project adopts a multi-pronged approach to address the challenges to renewable energy and energy efficiency dissemination in the outer islands and to link such dissemination to addressing the broader challenge of outer island economic development. It addresses capacity gaps through training and outreach, facilitate adoption and enforcement of needed policies, promote the financing of outer island renewable energy and energy efficiency, address cost and technical challenges, and brings these together through demonstrations. It emphasizes the productive use of renewable energy and energy efficiency, expanding beyond institutional systems alone to include community systems that can support revenue generating activity supporting coconut, fish, and agricultural sectors."

Further, the project allocates at least 50% of funds for income-generating activities to initiatives that primarily benefit women, particularly in agriculture. At the next level, the project ensures that women are well-represented among trainees. In particular, the “Solar Mama” solar home system (SHS) procurement, installation, and repair training program will train 40 middle-aged women from the outer islands. Experience in other countries has shown that ensuring women trainees empower women, but it also leads to greater sustainability of results, as women (especially women that already have children) are less likely to out-migrate for work. Other gender targets include at least 40% of female participation in trainings and workshops, and 30% female representation consultant roles."
