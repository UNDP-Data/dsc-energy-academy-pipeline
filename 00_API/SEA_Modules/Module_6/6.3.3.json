Its impacts are not felt equally across populations. Instead, climate change amplifies existing inequalities, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities such as women, Indigenous Peoples, youth, low-income households, and people with disabilities. To fully grasp these disparities, it is essential to apply an intersectional lens. Environmental factors often affect individuals differently based on their social roles and identities. For example, women in rural areas may struggle to access clean energy due to cultural norms that limit their decision-making power, while low-income communities may experience energy poverty more acutely during extreme weather events. Similarly, environmental degradation can exacerbate gender-based violence, as resource scarcity and displacement increase tensions and insecurity. In conflict zones and refugee camps, women who must leave their communities to gather firewood for cooking or heating face an increased risk of violence, including assault and exploitation. On the other hand, empowering women and marginalized groups economically, socially, and politically can drive more effective climate action and environmental conservation (OECD, 2023)"

Currently, 38% of NDCs and 56% of LTS reflect these principles, with the support of various global initiatives. The creation of a dedicated Just Transition Work Programme at COP28 in Dubai marked a significant step forward in this endeavor. This is important because clear signposting of comprehensive climate policy frameworks that consider the implications of a just transition can guide financial actors in translating them into a pipeline of viable or investment-ready projects."

The amunas function by diverting seasonal water from mountain streams into infiltration basins, allowing it to seep into the ground and sustain aquifers over time. This traditional method not only mitigates the impact of climate change on water availability but also promotes biodiversity by reducing the need for new dams. (Nature, 2024) · In Australia, Aboriginal fire management practices—often referred to as \"right way fire\"—integrate traditional ecological knowledge with modern scientific methods to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from unmanaged wildfires. These practices involve the strategic use of \"cool burns\" during the early dry season, which reduce fuel loads and create firebreaks, thereby preventing the occurrence of large, uncontrolled wildfires that typically release significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.

Larger systems such as solar photovoltaic mini-grids have addressed institutional needs, mainly boarding schools but lack financial and technical sustainability. Imported energy efficient cook stoves have seen limited adoption due to high costs and lack of awareness. Launched in 2020 by UNDP, the GEF-funded POIDIER project adopts a multi-pronged approach to address the challenges to renewable energy and energy efficiency dissemination in the outer islands and to link such dissemination to addressing the broader challenge of outer island economic development. It addresses capacity gaps through training and outreach, facilitate adoption and enforcement of needed policies, promote the financing of outer island renewable energy and energy efficiency, address cost and technical challenges, and brings these together through demonstrations. It emphasizes the productive use of renewable energy and energy efficiency, expanding beyond institutional systems alone to include community systems that can support revenue generating activity supporting coconut, fish, and agricultural sectors."

              "text": "The project adopts a human-rights based approach, particularly focusing on the indigenous populations of Kiribati's outer islands. The project enhances the livelihoods of indigenous people by providing off-grid renewable energy and energy-efficient cook stoves to improve daily life and support income-generating opportunities. The project emphasizes creating income-generating activities that utilize renewable energy. It implements Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) (discussed in more detail in Module 3), in line with Standard 6 of UNDP Environmental and Social Standards and conducts extensive consultations with local communities to ensure their participation and respect their rights and preferences. Additionally, a grievance redress mechanism is established in collaboration with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Energy (MISE) to address any concerns arising from project activities. Inclusivity is a key focus, with efforts made to ensure that marginalized and disadvantaged groups participate in decision-making and benefit from the project's income-generating activities."

              "text": "The POIDIER project promote gender equality and women’s empowerment through various initiatives at multiple levels, from local communities to national and international stages. At the local level, it ensures that at least 50% of participants in community consultations and decision-making sessions are women. Further, the project allocates at least 50% of funds for income-generating activities to initiatives that primarily benefit women, particularly in agriculture. At the next level, the project ensures that women are well-represented among trainees. In particular, the “Solar Mama” solar home system (SHS) procurement, installation, and repair training program will train 40 middle-aged women from the outer islands. Experience in other countries has shown that ensuring women trainees empower women, but it also leads to greater sustainability of results, as women (especially women that already have children) are less likely to out-migrate for work. Other gender targets include at least 40% of female participation in trainings and workshops, and 30% female representation consultant roles."

Key lessons highlight the importance of preliminary analysis of the energy context in order to identify structural gaps and build systemic solutions. In addition, the project showcases the effectiveness of targeted training accompanied by demonstration activities to bolster community engagement and local capabilities. Furthermore, the project's human-rights-based approach ensured the incorporation of indigenous populations' rights through protocols like Free, Prior, and Informed Consent. Similarly, it presents valuable lessons learned of commitment to gender equality and women's empowerment by considering targeted initiatives aimed at enhancing female representation and participation across various project facets. The training design addressed intersectional aspects such as gender and age, including specific programs to empower middle-aged women from the outer islands by equipping them with skills in solar home system procurement, installation, and repair. The project's dedication to inclusive and equitable practices presents promising strategies for replicability."
