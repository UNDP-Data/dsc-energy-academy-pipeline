              "text": "Climate change can stress the availability and efficiency of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Biofuels, which rely on plant, algal, or animal biomass, are particularly vulnerable to temperature fluctuations. For example, reduced rainfall can lower crop yields, such as cassava, which is used in bioethanol production. Sudden temperature spikes further contribute to declining yields, disrupting biofuel supply chains. Climate change can influence the availability and efficiency of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Changes in weather patterns, such as alterations in wind speeds, precipitation levels, and solar radiation, can impact the output of these renewable energy systems. Changes in precipitation patterns and glacier melt rates affect water availability for hydropower generation. Droughts can reduce water flow, leading to decreased hydropower output, while extreme rainfall events can cause flooding and damage to hydropower infrastructure. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that hydropower plans that have long lifespans from 50 to 100 years are likely to be impacted by climate change."

Most of the additional energy demand was met by increased supply from renewables and natural gas. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns influence the demand for energy, especially for cooling during heatwaves and heating during cold spells. One of the most pronounced impacts of climate change on energy consumption lies in the realm of cooling demand. As temperatures around the world continue to rise, and at the same time there is a rapidly emerging middle class in Asia and India, the demand for cooling systems and air conditioning in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings is escalating."

              "text": "Heatwaves, which are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, drive up the need for indoor cooling and dehumidification to maintain comfort and safety and prevent heat stroke and potential deaths. This surge in cooling demand places significant stress on electricity grids, particularly during peak demand periods, leading to potential supply shortages and grid instability. Conversely, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns also play a pivotal role in shaping heating energy demand. In regions experiencing milder winters due to climate change, there is a reduction in the need for heating systems, leading to decreased energy consumption. However, in areas facing more frequent and severe cold waves, heating energy demand might increase, offsetting the reductions seen in regions with milder winters. These variations in heating demand create a complex energy consumption landscape that requires dynamic and adaptive energy planning and management strategies. Moreover, other extreme weather events, including hurricanes, floods, and storms, also disrupt electricity generation, distribution, and transport infrastructure. The transportation sector, a significant consumer of energy globally, is also impacted by climate change in profound ways. Rising temperatures influence travel patterns, vehicle efficiency, and fuel consumption, leading to changes in energy demand. Higher temperatures can reduce the efficiency of internal combustion engines and electric vehicles alike and require increased air conditioning systems in vehicles, resulting in increased fuel consumption per kilometer traveled."

Funded by the Government of Japan, the project aims to safeguard the Colchic forest ecosystem in Machakheli Valley by introducing energy-efficient technologies like solar panels and water heaters in local communities while tackling the hazards of forest degradation brought on by over-exploitation of fuelwood, climate change, and global challenges. The project aimed to enhance the protection of the forests, reduce climate change-associated risks and enable access to clean and affordable energy. Solar water heaters and photovoltaic panels were selected as primary technologies, and training sessions and digital monitoring tools were provided. 200 heaters and 70 panels were procured, followed by targeted installation in vulnerable households. A feasibility study on biomass production was conducted, leveraging Japanese partners' expertise. Awareness-raising activities, supported by local NGOs, promoted the benefits of renewable energy. A monitoring system tracked key metrics like energy savings, fuelwood reduction, and emissions decreases. Partnerships with the Ministry of Agriculture, Khelvachauri Municipality, Machakhela National Park, UNDP's Country Office, and the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture ensured coordinated, policy-aligned implementation."

Thus, providing clean, affordable, and sustainable energy access is one of the country’s challenges. Malawi generates 98% of the electricity supply from six run-of-river hydropower projects on the Shire River. While hydropower has been a useful energy source, the country’s heavy reliance on it exposes Malawi to hydrological risks, particularly fluctuations in rainfall patterns. For example, during periods of reduced rainfall, such as the droughts experienced in 2023 and 2024, hydropower generation has been significantly impacted, leading to power shortages and unreliable electricity supply. These challenges underscore the importance of diversifying the country’s energy sources to reduce vulnerability and ensure energy security. In addition, to meet the rising electricity demand and to provide access to energy for low-income people in rural areas, the development of decentralized energy supply is being presented as a potential solution."

This includes a lack of access to upfront costs, limited awareness, and institutional capacity at the district and community level to operate and maintain mini-grid schemes, and an absence of systematic information and data collection on best practices for scaling up mini-grid development. The Increasing Access to Clean and Affordable Decentralized Energy Service in Selected Vulnerable Areas project, funded by the Global Environment Fund and UNDP, aims to achieve the imperative of energy access in remote rural areas with low carbon impact by developing commercially oriented mini-grids through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and ensuring its operations in a self-sustaining way. The project adopted three approaches to enhance the clean energy mini-grid in Malawi; the first approach focused on enhancing Mulajie Electrification Generation Agency (MEGA), the first vertically integrated privately-owned mini-grid in Mulaju, to increase customer connection and electricity production capacity."

Further, Community Energy Malawi, an installer and supplier of renewable energy technologies, commissioned an 80 KWP solar PV in Muchinin, which is expected to connect 150 households, primarily schools, health posts, and maize mills. In addition, Practical Action, a global development charity, planned to install a 300KW hydro mini-grid to provide access for 500 households and support coffee estates in Usingini. Moreover, as part of policy support work, the national energy policy has been approved, and 5 mini-grid case studies were developed as a toolkit for knowledge covering the technology, finance model, and policy regulation aspect while integrating lessons learned. Overall, the project serves as a good model for adopting holistic approaches to address the core challenges faced in the mini-grid sector and highlights the importance of public-private partnership, creating a supportive policy and regulatory framework alongside a capacity and knowledge-sharing platform. Currently, the project is closed, and the impact is expected to be further compiled and reported."
