Most of this comes from fossil fuel use, particularly coal. Industrial emissions have risen by 70% since 2000, driven by growing global demand for goods. While emissions stabilized during the COVID-19 pandemic, they rebounded in 2021. A 2% decline in 2022 was due mainly to reduced activity in China's industrial sector and the global energy crisis. However, emissions in other regions continued to rise, and global industrial emissions are likely to grow under a baseline scenario."

              "text": "Decarbonizing heavy industry remains complex. Many industrial processes involve chemical reactions that inherently produce CO2 emissions, such as calcination in cement production, making full decarbonization particularly challenging. Additionally, many processes require high-temperature heat, and current low-carbon technologies either cannot fully replace fossil fuels or remain prohibitively expensive. Over half of the emissions reductions needed in the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario rely on technologies not yet market-ready. Industrial assets also have long lifetimes, making them infrequently replaced. In 2022, the industrial sector emitted 9.0 Gt of CO2. This represented a slight decline from previous years but was insufficient to meet the NZE trajectory. To reach NZE, emissions must fall to about 7 Gt CO2 by 2030, a 3% annual reduction. However, progress is hindered by the high cost of clean technologies such as green hydrogen, the absence of strong market incentives, and regulatory uncertainty. A lack of consistent carbon pricing mechanisms and industrial emissions standards further slows investment in low-carbon alternatives."

However, efficiency improvements alone cannot achieve deep decarbonization. They can only lower fuel consumption by 15–20% in most cases. Material efficiency also offers opportunities. Recycled (secondary) production, life cycle emissions considerations, waste reduction, and circular economy models can all contribute. Governments can accelerate these shifts through regulations such as minimum efficiency performance standards for electric motors. Additionally, energy storage solutions, such as thermal storage and battery systems, can help manage energy demand fluctuations and integrate renewable power into industrial processes."

Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, is a promising alternative to coal, with the potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate industries (sectors that rely on high-temperature heat or produce process emissions that are difficult to eliminate) such as steel, cement, and chemicals. These industries cannot easily electrify due to the nature of their production processes, making hydrogen a key alternative. Unlike fossil fuels, hydrogen combustion does not release CO2, and it can serve as both a fuel and a feedstock in industrial processes. Hydrogen demand is expected to rise from 55 Mt in 2022 to 70 Mt by 2030. Meanwhile, the electrification of industrial processes must increase. Electricity's share of the sector's energy use grows from 23% to nearly 30% by 2030, with renewable sources playing a key role under the IEA NZE Scenario."

Financial incentives, such as concessional loans and subsidies, can ease the high upfront costs of clean energy solutions. Voluntary agreements with businesses can encourage gradual adoption of green practices without stifling industrial growth. Public policies like green procurement can create demand for sustainable products, boosting domestic low-carbon industries. However, regulatory measures must also play a role. Emissions trading systems and carbon pricing can be adapted to local contexts, ensuring they do not disproportionately burden small and medium enterprises. Equally importantly, robust data collection, reporting, and standards are essential to track progress and attract international climate finance."

Support for research, development, and deployment (RD&D) is also needed. Governments and investors should back large projects that test near zero-emission technologies. Acting early in this decade can lower costs and help these technologies spread faster.
