              "text": "This chapter explores the relationship between energy systems and climate change, focusing on how energy production, distribution, and consumption contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, and how climate change, in turn, affects energy systems. It underscores the importance of decarbonizing the energy sector to meet global climate goals, particularly the Paris Agreement’s target of limiting global temperature rise to below 2°C. The chapter highlights the significant role of the energy sector in global emissions, with electricity generation, transportation, and buildings being major contributors. The chapter also examines the environmental challenges associated with renewable energy development, such as land use conflicts, habitat disruption, and the ecological impacts of mining for materials needed in renewable technologies. It emphasizes the need for sustainable practices, including careful site selection, integrated planning, and the use of green production inputs, to minimize negative environmental and social impacts. Additionally, the chapter discusses how climate change affects energy systems, including the availability and efficiency of renewable energy sources, the operational challenges faced by thermal power plants, and the increasing strain on energy distribution networks due to extreme weather events. It also addresses the rising energy demand driven by climate change, particularly for cooling during heatwaves, and the need for adaptive strategies to ensure energy security and efficiency."
