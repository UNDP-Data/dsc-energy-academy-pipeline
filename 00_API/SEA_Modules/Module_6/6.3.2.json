Climate change can lead to facility damage, for example to coal, natural gas, and nuclear thermal power plants, which can suffer damage from extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and heatwaves. Climate events can also impact thermal power plantsâ€™ typical operation through variations in local cooling water availability, hydraulic head intake level, and temperature. Similarly, solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric dams are vulnerable to extreme weather events and environmental changes, leading to physical damage and reduced energy production. Due to climate change, some transmission and distribution networks can be damaged, ie. lines, substations, transformers, while grid infrastructure are also susceptible to damage from extreme weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, ice storms, and wildfires. One can also note that coastal and low-lying areas with energy infrastructure are at risk from sea-level rise, storm surges, and increased precipitation, leading to flooding and infrastructure damage. To add to this, energy storage facilities such as battery systems are vulnerable to extreme temperatures, flooding, and other climate-related hazards, leading to reduced efficiency, capacity loss, and operational challenges."

Thus, efficiency reduction due to climate change impacts can result in higher energy consumption, increased operational costs, and reduced system reliability for energy producers and consumers. Energy systems such as Thermal Power plants can suffer from heat stress when higher temperatures affect the cooling systems and increase the cooling demand. If this is not attended to, it often leads to a reduction in the efficiency of thermal power plants.The efficiency of solar panels may be affected by extreme temperatures ( either very high or very low) which are made more prevalent because of climate change. With wind turbines, changes in wind patterns / high speeds due to climate variability lead to reduced energy production. Transformers and other distribution components can also be derated due to operating at extreme temperatures, and the lack of cooling times due to higher overnight temperatures, as well as usage pattern changes. Similarly, droughts can also affect the performance of hydro power plants."

By systematically analyzing these factors, energy planners can develop targeted strategies to mitigate risks, enhance resilience, and ensure a stable energy supply. The following sections explore key components of vulnerability assessment, including risk mapping and the identification of physical and operational vulnerabilities. The vulnerability assessment focuses primarily on physical and operational risks, which are foundational to understanding infrastructure resilience. However, financial vulnerability is also a crucial aspect, particularly in the context of cost-benefit analysis (CBA). While this section emphasizes infrastructure and operational weaknesses, financial risks, including investment gaps and cost implications of climate impacts, are addressed in Module 4."

Globally, different regions exhibit unique vulnerabilities based on their geographical and climatic conditions. For instance, in Europe, the increased risk of flooding threatens to disrupt power generation and distribution networks, while in Asia, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Himalayan region, the risk includes typhoons and the impact of melting glaciers on hydropower facilities. Similarly, in Africa, drought conditions pose a significant threat to hydroelectric power sources, which are crucial for the region's energy supply."

These events can cause direct damage to facilities, disrupt service, and lead to long-term outages.

Evaluating operational vulnerabilities involves analyzing how well the energy system can withstand fluctuations in supply and demand, particularly those that may be exacerbated by climate change, such as increased demand for cooling during heatwaves or the variability of renewable energy sources. It should also take into account reduced cooling periods due to higher average temperatures as well as changes in usage patterns. It's also important to consider that the impacts of climate change on energy systems can be amplified by systemic factors such as energy system interdependencies, water scarcity, and increased electricity demand. These broader considerations play into vulnerability evaluations as they affect the overall robustness and reliability of the energy supply chain."

Integrating DERs requires not only technology but also regulatory frameworks, market mechanisms, and incentives that support their adoption and operation. Effective integration into the existing grid infrastructure is key, including the need for smart grid technologies that can manage the two-way flow of electricity and information.
