Operations alone are responsible for 30% of global final energy use and 26% of energy-related emissions, with 8% from direct emissions and 18% from indirect emissions tied to electricity and heat production. While direct emissions slightly decreased to 3 Gt in 2022, indirect emissions rose to nearly 6.8 Gt due to increased reliance on electricity. Despite some progress, the sector remains off-track to meet the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario. Addressing this requires a concerted effort to improve energy efficiency and adopt renewable energy technologies."

Building energy codes, which are essential for driving efficiency, exist in only 44 countries, leaving 82% of the global population in countries without such standards. This is especially concerning as global floor space is projected to grow by 20% from 2020 to 2030, primarily in developing economies. Additionally, decarbonizing the sector requires more than just new standards; retrofitting existing buildings remains a major challenge due to aging infrastructure (especially in advanced economies), poor insulation, and outdated design. Developing economies face the dual challenge of improving access to modern energy services, such as cooling, while simultaneously reducing emissions. Without immediate action, these regions risk becoming significant sources of energy demand and emissions growth. Policies, investments, and technologies must address this rapidly growing need while avoiding path dependencies that could hinder future decarbonization efforts."

The IEA estimates that 25% of emissions reductions needed by 2050 could come from energy efficiency improvements in heating, cooling, lighting, and ventilation. Renewable technologies, such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and solar thermal systems, could contribute an additional 30%. Governments are increasingly introducing measures to phase out fossil-fuel-based systems. This includes banning fossil-fueled heating appliances and limiting connections to gas grids for new buildings. Technologies such as heat pumps, which are rapidly gaining market share, are a cornerstone of this transition. Heat pumps are especially effective in well-insulated buildings, where their lower heating demand reduces costs and energy use."
