              "text": "Transport relies heavily on internal combustion engines (ICE) powered by fossil fuels. It accounts for over one-third of CO2 emissions from end-use sectors. In 2022, passenger and cargo activity rebounded after the Covid-19 pandemic. This led to a 3% rise in transport CO2 emissions compared to 2021. From 1990 to 2022, transport emissions grew at an average annual rate of 1.7%, the same as industry. To align with the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 Scenario, transport emissions must decrease by more than 3% annually until 2030. Achieving this requires swift road vehicle electrification, improved energy efficiency, scaled-up low-emissions fuels in maritime and aviation, and policies that promote shifts to less carbon-intensive transport modes. Here, we will focus on road transport. Electrification is the most promising path to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency in road transport."

Even more significant is that more than 1 in 2 of these EVs are being produced in China, reshaping the global automotive landscape and challenging traditional industry leaders. This transformation extends far beyond transportation. For countries in the Global South, it is a chance to leapfrog directly to clean transportation options.

However, more importantly, their significance extends beyond decarbonization, aligning with broader developmental objectives. Particularly, the opportunity lies in electrifying micro-mobility, first and last-mile transport, and public transport systems, thereby contributing to a more equitable and socially just access to services and opportunities within these regions. E-mobility also offers a promising pathway to improved health outcomes by reducing air pollution, a significant concern in low- and middle-income countries, where 89% of the 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide occur due to pollution. Moreover, a compelling case for EVs can be made in countries that have a transport culture that is supported by sizeable oil importers. For instance, in Small Island Developing States heavily reliant on fossil fuels, e-mobility can reduce fossil fuel dependence and enhance energy security, addressing the volatility of gas and oil prices that disproportionately affect people."

A focus on shared electric vehicles, for example, holds promise for reducing inequalities and improving well-being.

Further safeguarding environmental integrity in e-transport calls for sustainable national waste management strategies and infrastructure. Circular approaches are important, such as using second-life batteries for stationary energy storage and adopting battery reuse and recycling practices.

              "text": "The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) projects 1,780 million electric cars on the road by 2050. This is a dramatic increase from 18 million in 2019. Such growth will create enormous demand for electricity. IRENA estimates that transport electrification will account for 10% of electricity demand by 2030 and nearly 50% by 2050. To support this transition, power grids must adapt. They need to supply renewable-based electricity to meet growing EV demand. Smart electrification strategies will play a key role. These strategies can integrate more renewable energy, reduce peak loads, and limit the need for costly grid investments."

              "text": "While e-mobility may not be a silver bullet for all transport challenges, including congestion and accessibility, it undoubtedly brings a multitude of benefits and contributes significantly to both development and climate action goals. Ultimately, the goal must be to create sustainable urban mobility systems centred around public transport. This approach could help bridge the global divide in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11, particularly its target to provide sustainable transportation for all. Electrification, active mobility, micro-mobility solutions, green fleets and mobility-as-a-service – these are exciting starting points for a transformational shift in energy and transport, one that would unlock broad development benefits for people around the world."
