              "text": "As we conclude this chapter, it is evident that the path to universal energy access is fraught with significant challenges that demand urgent and targeted responses. The exploration of the global energy divide reveals stark disparities, from urban-rural gaps to the unique hurdles faced by vulnerable populations in crisis-affected regions. While progress has been made in electricity access and clean cooking solutions, substantial gaps remain, particularly for those in remote and low-income areas. The insights gained throughout this chapter underscore the necessity for tailored, innovative and context-specific approaches that prioritize the specific needs of unserved and marginalized communities. Addressing these barriers—whether through improved infrastructure, strategic allocation of investments, or comprehensive measurement frameworks—will be essential in achieving sustainable energy access for all."
