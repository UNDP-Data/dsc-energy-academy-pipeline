              "text": "The concept of a just energy transition is multifaceted, with no single, universally accepted definition. Its interpretation varies across different social, economic, and political contexts. At its core, a just transition seeks to balance the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions with the responsibility to ensure that both the benefits and burdens of this shift are distributed equitably. This lesson will explore how a just transition goes beyond technical solutions and policy frameworks—it is about addressing deep-rooted socio-economic disparities, fostering participatory governance, and empowering all stakeholders as active agents of change. It emphasizes equal access to the benefits of the transition, such as clean energy and energy security, ensuring they are not limited to certain regions or privileged groups but are shared across all of society."

              "text": "The concept of a just transition originated in the 1980s through advocacy by global trade unions, which sought to safeguard workers displaced by environmental regulations, exemplified by initiatives like the \"Superfund for Workers\" to support fossil fuel industry employees. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO, 2024) , a just transition involves greening the economy in a manner that maximizes fairness and inclusivity for all stakeholders. Equity must be integrated into policies and strategies, with inclusivity serving as a guiding principle to engage every community, worker, and social group in decision-making processes (Sovacool et al., 2017). This approach aims to generate decent work opportunities, leaving no one behind in the process. However, contemporary scholarship has expanded this framework beyond labor-centric concerns to integrate climate, energy, and environmental justice, ensuring inclusivity for historically marginalized groups, Indigenous communities, and regions disproportionately impacted by both climate change and transition policies."

              "text": "Raphael Heffron, a leading scholar in this field, argues that a just transition requires a \"triumvirate of justice tenets\": distributional equity (fair resource allocation), procedural fairness (inclusive decision-making), and restorative measures (addressing historical harms) (Heffron & de Fontenelle, 2024). This approach moves beyond the ILO’s traditional focus on labor rights to emphasize multisectoral equity, aligning with the Paris Agreement’s call for holistic climate action. For instance, Heffron’s work highlights the need to repurpose fossil fuel infrastructure while ensuring communities dependent on extractive industries receive retraining, renewable job opportunities, and participatory governance. Critically, the transition must reconcile global climate goals with localized realities. Poorly contextualized policies risk exacerbating inequalities, particularly in the Global South, where energy demand grows alongside entrenched poverty (McCauley & Heffron, 2018). Effective strategies involve decentralizing decision-making to engage local stakeholders—governments, businesses, Indigenous leaders, and civil society—in designing context-specific solutions, such as community-owned solar microgrids or gender-inclusive green job programs. By prioritizing restorative justice and participatory frameworks, the transition can transcend tokenistic inclusivity, ensuring environmental sustainability and socio-economic equity are mutually reinforcing"

Traditionally, it has focused on ensuring fair treatment and involvement of people from all backgrounds in shaping environmental policies and laws.

Climate change disproportionately affects women, children, and marginalized communities, making environmental justice essential to addressing these deepening inequalities."

In this context, achieving a just energy transition through effective, accountable, and inclusive energy governance is crucial for addressing immediate national development priorities, environmental concerns, safeguarding human rights, and preserving social stability."
