While challenges such as informal labor markets, fragmented land rights, and cultural ties to natural resources complicate progress, access to affordable finance stands as the foremost barrier. High capital costs for clean energy technologies, coupled with limited concessional funding and high borrowing rates, stifle the adoption of renewables in low-income countries. For instance, solar and wind projects in sub-Saharan Africa face financing costs up to seven times higher than in advanced economies, perpetuating reliance on cheaper, polluting alternatives (CATF, 2023). This “affordability gap” entrenches energy poverty, as 571 million people in Sub-Saharan African remain without electricity access despite abundant renewable potential."

Initiatives must prioritize vocational training, data collection on gendered energy poverty, and inclusive stakeholder dialogues to ensure women benefit equitably from green job creation. Simultaneously, aligning climate and development goals demands scaling innovative financing mechanisms—such as blended finance and green bonds—to de-risk investments in decentralized solar microgrids, energy-efficient agriculture, and electric mobility. As Atteridge et al. (2022) note, synergizing these efforts can unlock co-benefits, like job creation in off-grid solar sectors, which employ over 370,000 people across Africa (World Bank, 2023)."

Bridging this gap necessitates reorienting financial flows to prioritize affordable, community-owned solutions—such as pay-as-you-go solar systems in rural Bangladesh or women-led clean cooking cooperatives in Kenya—while leveraging public funds to attract private capital (World Bank, 2023). For example, the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) in South Africa and Indonesia aim to mobilize $46 billion by 2030, yet critics highlight insufficient focus on retraining fossil fuel workers or ensuring gender parity in renewable sectors (GIGA, 2024). By centering equity in finance and policy design, the Global South can navigate the dual imperatives of expanding energy access and achieving climate resilience, ensuring no community is left behind in the race to net-zero."

The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), including Russia and Kazakhstan, derives 88% of its primary energy from fossil fuels, predominantly natural gas (55%) and oil (28%). In the Asia-Pacific region, fossil fuels represent 83% of primary energy, with coal alone contributing 42%—the highest regional coal share globally—driven by demand in China, India, and Southeast Asia. Africa sources 83% of its primary energy from fossil fuels, though this masks sub-regional disparities: North Africa relies heavily on gas (65%), while Southern Africa depends on coal (72%) (Energy Institute, 2023) This enduring reliance underscores fossil fuels’ role in ensuring energy security and supporting livelihoods.

Abrupt decarbonization in fossil fuel-dependent regions risks destabilizing labor markets and energy access, particularly in communities where extractive industries underpin livelihoods. For example, coal-reliant regions like Jharkhand (India) and Mpumalanga (South Africa) require targeted workforce retraining and investments in renewable industrial hubs to diversify economies while safeguarding jobs. Similarly, gas-dependent nations like Algeria and Iran must prioritize methane emissions reduction and integrate renewable energy into existing infrastructure to align with climate goals without compromising near-term energy security. The energy transition must be framed not as a wholesale phase-out of fossil fuels but as a shift in investment priorities. In the Global South, where energy demand is projected to grow significantly, the challenge lies in redirecting new investments toward cost-competitive clean energy solutions—particularly in power generation—while acknowledging that limited fossil fuel projects may still play a transitional role in meeting immediate energy needs. Organizations like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and African Development Bank (AfDB) recognize this duality, noting that strategic fossil fuel investments in regions like sub-Saharan Africa may be necessary to address energy poverty while renewables scale."

A just transition demands policies that prioritize economic resilience and social equity, such as inclusive job creation in renewable sectors and safeguards for vulnerable communities. The path forward requires tailored, context-sensitive approaches: In coal-dependent economies, phased transitions paired with renewable workforce development. In gas-exporting nations, modernizing infrastructure to reduce emissions while leveraging renewable energy potential. Across the Global South, scaling decentralized solar and wind projects to meet rising demand affordably, bypassing fossil lock-in. By aligning strategies with local realities and prioritizing clean energy investments where most viable, the global community can advance climate goals while fostering inclusive development—a balance central to UNDP’s mandate of equitable sustainability."

This oversight risks sparking widespread local resistance, as communities impacted by either renewable installations or mineral mining may suffer adverse consequences without reaping the promised benefits of energy access and sustainable development. A truly just energy transition must therefore recognize and address the unique challenges associated with both sectors, ensuring that the rights and well-being of all affected communities are safeguarded. The Indian Rewa Mega Solar project and lithium mining in Argentina exemplify the challenges associated with renewable energy land use. The Rewa project, intended to generate renewable energy for urban areas, has adversely affected rural communities, leading to loss of livelihoods and disruptions in agrarian lifestyles. Similarly, lithium mining in Argentina reflects extractivist approaches, prioritizing mineral extraction over other socio-economic opportunities. These practices, often described as \"green energy colonialism,\" have sparked tensions and conflicts over land use, exacerbated by overlooked seasonal land-use patterns and unfulfilled promises of employment opportunities."

Land rights in many developing countries, particularly in the Global South, are often not clearly defined, regulated, or recognized, leading to various challenges and inequities. For instance, in Colombia, approximately 52% of land tenure in rural areas was informal in 2019, contributing to inequitable land ownership distribution. Despite legal provisions granting women rights to land, social norms, and limited access to resources like finance often hinder their ability to exercise these rights effectively. Similarly, in Ghana, male farm ownership exceeds that of women by more than three times, especially for medium and large farms. Indonesia faces challenges regarding land ownership, particularly in forest and land management, due to a complex mix of traditional, customary, formal, and informal arrangements, leading to legal ambiguity and tenure insecurity, which in turn perpetuates land-related conflicts and affects community livelihoods. Indigenous communities, whose territories often overlap with areas designated for timber or palm oil concessions, face particular challenges due to the lack of recognition of their customary laws, leading to conflicts over land use."

In 2024, the Serbian government reinstated Rio Tinto's mining license for the $2.4 billion project, which had previously been revoked due to environmental concerns and public opposition. This decision sparked widespread protests, with thousands of citizens expressing fears over potential environmental destruction and the displacement of local communities (Financial Times, 2024). The insecurity of land tenure exacerbates existing socio-economic problems and inequalities during energy transitions. Unclear or lacking tenure can exclude individuals from support strategies, such as assistance for adaptation or low-carbon land management, and hinder access to interventions aimed at mitigating greenhouse gas emissions or enhancing resilience in the forestry sector. Moreover, unclear land tenure may affect eligibility for emergency programs and financial transfers intended to assist vulnerable groups during the transition. Therefore, the planning of climate-related interventions impacting land must carefully consider potential impacts on individuals, particularly women, who lack secure tenure."

Forests serve not only as a source of livelihood but also as a core component of community identity and spirituality. Thus, when climate transitions relate to forest resource management and restrict access to forests, transition planners must engage with communities beyond offering alternative livelihood strategies. Psychological impacts and mental health problems are common in major socio-economic transitions, as documented in mining communities when mines close and communities are left with few livelihood options. Unfortunately, these issues are not always addressed effectively in the development of climate policy. In Colombia, where one third of the territory is managed under collective ownership by indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities, their involvement as stakeholders in discussions about land-use change and deforestation is crucial but often overlooked. Engaging with these communities in dialogue is essential for establishing and achieving the country's NDC goals effectively.

As part of this initiative, women have accessed cost-effective methods to enhance their businesses. They have adopted innovative biomass energy forms and modern technologies, leading to improved home enterprises and reduced energy costs. For example, in Tangalle, a major deep-sea fishing center where women are key players in the local dry fish industry, the Sustainable Biomass Energy Project introduced improved dryers to rural communities, which significantly benefited women entrepreneurs. A 40 KW flatbed dryer for nine women greatly enhanced production, productivity, and incomes. Working hours decreased from ten to four hours daily, while monthly production increased from 200 kgs to 800 kgs. After two years, the modern biomass dryer elevated the quality of the final product, leading to improved living standards for the participating women."

During the off-season, the dryers are used to dry other local agricultural products such as chilies, pepper, and cinnamon. This ensures that women continue to generate income even when fish production is low, creating greater financial stability and resilience. The transition to modern biomass fuels, such as briquettes or pellets, directly contributes to a more just energy transition. In countries like Sri Lanka, where biomass serves as a primary energy source, there is a critical need to enhance the use-efficiency of this resource. Conventional methods of biomass often inefficient and environmentally harmful, leading to high carbon emissions and significant health risks for women who are predominantly responsible for cooking and household energy management. Modern biomass fuels, on the other hand, offer a cleaner, more efficient alternative that reduces these negative impacts. The shift to modern biomass fuels and technologies not only lightens the physical burden on women by reducing the need for firewood collection but also enhances their economic empowerment by improving productivity and lowering energy costs. Modern technologies such as biomass ignition or drying can propel a more energy transition. This technology processes biomass into briquettes or pellets, which have better calorific value and emissions compared to directly burning biomass (such as firewood). This approach directly increases the efficiency of biomass utilization and reduces the negative environmental impacts associated with conventional methods. In the case of Tangalle, women using modern dryers have been able to produce higher-quality goods at a lower cost, making their businesses more competitive and sustainable. ."
