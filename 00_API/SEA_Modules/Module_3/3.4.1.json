Multilateral environmental governance, for instance, fosters accountability among actors by encouraging countries to increase their designated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), as outlined in the Paris Agreement (Averchenkova & Chan, 2023). Prior to 2023, the principles of just energy transition were already embedded in 38% of NDCs and 56% of long-term strategies (LTS), underscoring a growing recognition of the importance of equity and inclusivity in climate action (UNFCCC, 2023).

Developing countries face a particularly daunting task as they grapple with the need for hard data to anticipate changes and demonstrate the overwhelming benefits of transitioning to a green economy. This transition holds promise not only for environmental sustainability but also for achieving a just transition for society as a whole. To bridge this data gap and facilitate evidence-based just transition planning, the UNDP's Climate Promise initiative has been instrumental in guiding countries. Through qualitative and quantitative assessments, including modelling techniques, countries can estimate the impacts of NDCs on key socioeconomic indicators such as GDP, employment, skills, income distribution, and gender equality. These assessments enable countries to gain insights into the distributional impacts of NDCs and identify targeted measures to ensure a just transition, particularly for vulnerable populations such as women and informal workers."

Similarly, in Türkiye, the GJAM was utilized to analyse the potential effects of reducing coal's share in electricity production and increasing investments in wind and solar energy. Building upon this foundational work, efforts are underway to expand the scope of assessments to encompass broader socioeconomic implications associated with implementing NDCs and LTS. In Serbia, for example, a qualitative baseline analysis was undertaken as part of a just transition study focusing on coal-intensive regions and communities. This study, informed by international best practices, provides an overview of key considerations and offers a comprehensive seven-step roadmap along with follow-up actions to ensure a just transition. By leveraging such assessments and strategies, countries can navigate the complexities of transitioning to a green economy while leaving no one behind, thereby fostering sustainable development and social equity."

This entails the provision of welfare safety nets and adequate compensation for individuals, communities, and regions adversely affected by planned policies. Investment in human and institutional capital training assumes paramount importance as policy complexity escalates. Equipping stakeholders with the necessary skills and knowledge to navigate evolving policy landscapes effectively and fostering south-south cooperation are key to facilitating the sharing of best practices and experiences across countries and regions, thereby bolstering institutional capacities and policy integration for a just transition."

Empowering SMEs with the tools and resources needed to embrace sustainable practices contributes to fostering a conducive environment for green entrepreneurship and economic diversification. Through targeted support and collaboration, governments, alongside organizations like UNDP, can spearhead efforts to foster inclusive and sustainable development in alignment with the principles of a just transition. The patchwork of international and transnational initiatives underscores the need for greater coherence to foster responsible, sustainable, and transparent supply chains. While there has been a growing recognition of the challenges associated with the critical materials supply chain, the proliferation of voluntary initiatives and regulatory frameworks by governments, businesses, and civil society groups has resulted in a fragmented landscape of standards. This fragmentation risks sowing confusion among stakeholders and underscores the imperative for enhanced visibility and coherence."

Quantitative analysis examines changes in employment levels, considering direct, indirect, and induced jobs. Direct jobs relate to specific energy projects, such as construction and operations. Indirect jobs include those related to supplying materials for energy projects. Induced jobs are created when workers spend their income. Qualitative analysis moves beyond the sheer number of jobs to consider job quality, including salary levels, job security, and skill requirements. New jobs may may require shifting regions or sectors, and the longevity of jobs also varies, impacting the overall socioeconomic landscape."
