The unsettling issue of land dispossession affecting indigenous communities in regions designated for renewable energy and critical mineral mining projects can have severe repercussions, jeopardizing livelihoods and disrupting access to vital resources like food (Scheidel et al., 2023). Take, for instance, the production of lithium-ion batteries, which power our electronic devices and vehicles, presents its own set of challenges. Minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, crucial for these batteries, are often sourced through practices that disregard human rights and environmental well-being. In regions like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), communities face forced evictions, child labour, and dangerous working conditions in mines. Indigenous communities in areas like the Salar de Atacama also face threats to their rights and ecosystems due to lithium extraction."

There are positive developments in this direction. Many renewable project developers demonstrate effective community engagement and consultation, championing community investment programs and advocating for community ownership of projects. Furthermore, major players in the global energy arena are beginning to prioritize human rights, evident in their establishment of human rights policies and the integration of social and environmental considerations into energy investment decisions. Additionally, the engineering and construction sectors are actively addressing human rights challenges through collaborative efforts, as documented in a recent study by the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre. Indigenous communities, often residing in areas rich in renewable energy resources, face heightened risks of rights violations. Extractive practices can encroach upon indigenous lands, jeopardizing cultural heritage, livelihoods, and land connections. Respecting and upholding indigenous rights are not only an ethical imperative but also pivotal for fostering sustainable and inclusive renewable energy initiatives."

Embracing renewable energy sources, promoting circular economies, and exploring innovative technologies are key components of this transition. By addressing ethical dilemmas and sustainability challenges, renewable energy projects can contribute to a more equitable and sustainable future for all. The shift to renewable energy must avoid harming people or damaging the environment. Governments and businesses have a chance to create a fair transition that learns from the mistakes of the fossil fuel era. By respecting human rights and protecting nature, they can ensure renewable energy systems are sustainable and benefit everyone."

Long-term decarbonization strategies require widespread understanding and acceptance among various stakeholders, underlining the significance of engaging with a diverse range of actors, including governments, indigenous groups, businesses, experts, and households. However, public opposition to renewable energy projects often stems from a real or perceived lack of inclusion in planning and decision-making processes, leading to a deficit of trust and transparency. Traditionally, energy policy evaluation has centered on cost, environmental impact, and security of supply, sidelining the societal dimension. To bridge this gap, there is a growing interest in participatory and transdisciplinary approaches to energy system modeling and planning. A conceptual framing aims to democratize decision-making processes in energy projects by emphasizing meaningful integration of social acceptance into analysis."

The Wayúu people, Colombia's largest indigenous group, inhabit the Guajira region, which is targeted for the implementation of wind farms as part of Colombia's green transition plan. Despite their ancestral rights to the land, the Wayúu face marginalization and exclusion from basic infrastructure, including electricity and healthcare, due to poverty and historical neglect. The proposed wind farms not only threaten their land but also carry environmental risks, including deforestation and disruption of cultural practices such as dreaming."

Consultations are frequently initiated after project designs are already underway, limiting meaningful engagement and understanding of the implications among indigenous communities. Moreover, consultations lack cultural sensitivity and gender inclusivity, with women often excluded from decision-making processes. The involvement of companies in financing consultation processes raises concerns about the fairness and independence of these procedures. Additionally, the limited availability of information in languages like Wayuunaiki further impedes meaningful participation and informed decision-making."

It operates through two main axes: a “school of own thought” to discuss key territorial issues from indigenous knowledge and the law of origins, and the \"Pacto por La Yanama\" platform. This platform serves as a space for intercultural dialogue and relationship-building among the public sector, Wayúu indigenous communities, civil society, and the private sector. One of the activities, the \"Foro por la Yanama\" brought together 250 people to explore national and international perspectives on how different regions can adopt models for a just energy transition, ensuring development benefits the entire population while respecting and preserving local ancestral cultures. These two axes contribute to strengthening Wayúu's right to Prior Informed (FPIC)."

Secondly, the platform facilitates dialogue among various stakeholders, fostering the co-creation of consensual solutions. The “Pacto por la Yanama” promotes genuine dialogue, aiming to identify solutions harmonizing with culture and nature. The space seeks to enhance understanding of the Wayúu people, their culture, intimate ancestral ties with the territory, and the public and private actors in the region to foster respectful and systemic intercultural relationships. The inclusion of tools like the U-theory developed at MIT supports this dialogue. U-theory is a practical method focusing on leadership and systems change, building collective awareness, and advocating for societal evolution, emphasizing mindfulness and awareness in redesigning collective systems."

Still, this experience provides insights into a set of dialogue tools and the creation of a safe space to generate agreements. Recommendations from the “Pacto por La Yanama” emphasize the importance of sovereignty, solidarity and inclusive internal organization for the Wayúu, active listening and engagement and flexibility from government entities, and social innovation and collaboration from the private sector."
