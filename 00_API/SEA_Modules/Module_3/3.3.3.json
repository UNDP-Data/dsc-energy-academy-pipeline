Beyond refining raw minerals (e.g., lithium, cobalt), nations can ascend the value chain by localizing production of battery components, solar panels, or electric vehicle (EV) assembly, enhancing both economic resilience and their role in closing the global decarbonization gap. This transition requires policies that incentivize technology transfer, workforce training, and partnerships with global firms—ensuring developing economies are not just suppliers but innovators and competitors in the clean energy era."

              "text": "The journey of lithium from its extraction to its use in electric vehicles (EVs) is intricate, underscoring the complexity of the battery value chain. At the heart of a battery are two poles—an anode and a cathode—separated by electrolytes that enable ion movement during charging and discharging. Cathode compositions vary, utilizing different ratios of lithium and other minerals based on capacity, voltage, and technology. For example, NMC batteries contain cobalt, nickel, and manganese, while LFP batteries use iron and phosphates. These components undergo chemical processing to form lithium oxide, the active material in the cathode. The lithium battery production process spans multiple stages, each with distinct technologies, requirements, and market structures. The following Figure illustrates these stages and highlights the roles of various countries and regions along the value chain. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) hold 60% of the world’s lithium resources, primarily within the \"lithium triangle\" of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. Despite this, LAC countries contribute only 32% of global lithium production, even though they possess 52% of the world’s reserves."

              "text": "In 2022, the global cathode material market reached $21 billion, with projections for significant growth in the coming decade. China and Asia dominate cathode production, accounting for 93% of global output in 2019. Vertical integration is becoming more common, with battery manufacturing increasingly aligned with EV production to reduce transportation costs and risks. This trend toward integrated operations, especially near EV consumption hubs, is driven by cost efficiency and the need for stable mineral supplies. Lithium carbonate production for batteries requires substantial investment, and demand is expected to grow rapidly as the global energy transition accelerates. However, managing the socio-environmental impacts of lithium extraction and production requires coordinated efforts between public and private entities, modern and transparent institutions, and strong corporate social responsibility practices. Latin American countries must strengthen public-private and international partnerships to attract investment and develop their upstream value chains. Consolidating these partnerships is essential to leveraging lithium resources for economic development while positioning the region in new segments of the value chain."

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, cross-border knowledge exchange is key to progress. As LAC countries work to build local industrial capacity for battery production, opportunities exist to develop intermediate product manufacturing and integrate specialized local suppliers, thereby adding value to lithium production. The expansion of the lithium value chain in LAC is expected to align with rising demand for EVs and electrification. Local expertise in the automotive sector will be crucial for developing the lithium refining and cathode production industries, which can spur job creation and technological innovation. Countries such as Colombia, Chile, Panama, and Peru are already exploring electromobility strategies, including building centralized charging infrastructures as a first step in expanding EV adoption."

By recycling electronic waste to recover critical materials, the region can improve waste management while reducing socio-environmental impacts. Circular business models will be essential for strengthening the sustainability and resilience of local economies. However, to fully capitalize on the global energy transition, LAC must adopt a holistic approach that enhances production, industries, value chains, and consumption patterns. This requires coordinated action from both the public and private sectors, supported by effective governance and urgent collaboration, particularly in the strategic development of lithium resources within global supply chains."

This makes it an ideal candidate for becoming a hub of renewable energy manufacturing. Launched during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week 2023, the REMI program enhances the renewable energy sector in Africa and Southeast Asia through south-south cooperation . The initiative aims to accelerate the creation of green manufacturing capacity, support job creation and boost economic growth while meeting increasing energy demands. North African countries, particularly Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, are pivotal to this initiative due to their significant renewable energy potential and existing infrastructure."

The initiative seeks to reduce the reliance on imported technologies, thereby supporting sustainable economic growth and contribute to the country’s climate mitigation efforts, with Morocco expected to bolster solar PV and battery components. Given Morocco’s strong infrastructure and favourable policies, it is well positioned to become a key player in the renewable energy market. By 2030, the initiative expects that 8 to 14 million energy transition jobs in Africa could be created. Despite existing fiscal incentives like tax breaks and import duty exemptions that lower setup costs for renewable energy facilities, North African countries face several challenges. One significant barrier is the need for skilled labour and more robust infrastructure. The availability of these necessary production factors is crucial for high-value manufacturing. Building the necessary capabilities has been driven by training programs and the establishment of learning centres and research institutions, such as the Regional Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE) in Egypt and the Research Institute for Solar Energy and Renewable Energies (IRESEN) in Morocco."

For instance, 50% of the CSP solar field in the Kuraymat project in Egypt was manufactured locally. These LCRs help integrate local supply chains in developing renewable energy products."

To overcome the challenge of skilled labour shortages, REMI supports technical schools and worker exchange programs to scale up training and career development opportunities for engineers and technicians in North Africa. By strengthening institutions like RCREEE and IRESEN, the initiative ensures that adequate training and education are available to develop a skilled workforce. Furthermore, REMI assists in the creation of strong business cases for green manufacturers, identifying optimal operating models, and providing tailored advocacy and policy support to attract green manufacturing investments. Another strategy is providing end-to-end grant support for green manufacturing projects, from planning and financing to operations and sales. These pilot projects aim to demonstrate the viability of local manufacturing of solar PV, batteries, and e-mobility solutions. By ensuring that a portion of materials or labour is sourced locally through LCRs, the program nurtures domestic industries and integrates local supply chains in developing renewable energy products."
