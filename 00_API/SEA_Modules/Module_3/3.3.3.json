Lifecycle assessments offer insights into the total carbon footprint of energy sources, encompassing emissions throughout their entire lifecycle, including extraction, manufacturing, transportation, and disposal. While all electricity generation methods produce GHG emissions, fossil fuels demonstrate notably higher emissions intensity compared to renewable energies."

              "text": "The journey of lithium from its extraction to its use in electric vehicles (EVs) is intricate, underscoring the complexity of the battery value chain. At the heart of a battery are two poles—an anode and a cathode—separated by electrolytes that enable ion movement during charging and discharging. Cathode compositions vary, utilizing different ratios of lithium and other minerals based on capacity, voltage, and technology. For example, NMC batteries contain cobalt, nickel, and manganese, while LFP batteries use iron and phosphates. These components undergo chemical processing to form lithium oxide, the active material in the cathode. The lithium battery production process spans multiple stages, each with distinct technologies, requirements, and market structures. The following Figure illustrates these stages and highlights the roles of various countries and regions along the value chain. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) hold 60% of the world’s lithium resources, primarily within the \"lithium triangle\" of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. Despite this, LAC countries contribute only 32% of global lithium production, even though they possess 52% of the world’s reserves."

China and Asia dominate cathode production, accounting for 93% of global output in 2019. Vertical integration is becoming more common, with battery manufacturing increasingly aligned with EV production to reduce transportation costs and risks. This trend toward integrated operations, especially near EV consumption hubs, is driven by cost efficiency and the need for stable mineral supplies. Lithium carbonate production for batteries requires substantial investment, and demand is expected to grow rapidly as the global energy transition accelerates. However, managing the socio-environmental impacts of lithium extraction and production requires coordinated efforts between public and private entities, modern and transparent institutions, and strong corporate social responsibility practices. Latin American countries must strengthen public-private and international partnerships to attract investment and develop their upstream value chains. Consolidating these partnerships is essential to leveraging lithium resources for economic development while positioning the region in new segments of the value chain."

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, cross-border knowledge exchange is key to progress. As LAC countries work to build local industrial capacity for battery production, opportunities exist to develop intermediate product manufacturing and integrate specialized local suppliers, thereby adding value to lithium production. The expansion of the lithium value chain in LAC is expected to align with rising demand for EVs and electrification. Local expertise in the automotive sector will be crucial for developing the lithium refining and cathode production industries, which can spur job creation and technological innovation. Countries such as Colombia, Chile, Panama, and Peru are already exploring electromobility strategies, including building centralized charging infrastructures as a first step in expanding EV adoption."

Given Morocco’s strong infrastructure and favourable policies, it is well positioned to become a key player in the renewable energy market. By 2030, the initiative expects that 8 to 14 million energy transition jobs in Africa could be created. Despite existing fiscal incentives like tax breaks and import duty exemptions that lower setup costs for renewable energy facilities, North African countries face several challenges. One significant barrier is the need for skilled labour and more robust infrastructure. The availability of these necessary production factors is crucial for high-value manufacturing. Building the necessary capabilities has been driven by training programs and the establishment of learning centres and research institutions, such as the Regional Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE) in Egypt and the Research Institute for Solar Energy and Renewable Energies (IRESEN) in Morocco."
