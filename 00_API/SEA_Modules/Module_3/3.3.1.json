              "text": "The growing importance of sustained access to critical raw materials, especially energy transition minerals, has elevated their prominence on national economic agendas. As the demand for greener energy technologies accelerates, the impact on the entire mining value chain becomes increasingly significant across all sectors of society. Given UNDP's ongoing work on sustainable mining and extractives for development, this presents a key entry point for further engagement. The mining sector plays a pivotal role in the energy transition. Once the official UN framework on Critical Energy Transition Minerals is available, it will help address supply chain challenges, governance, social protection, and gender equality through a human rights-based approach. Potential solutions include encouraging extractive industries to adopt sustainable practices by redefining the value of natural resources and ecosystem services, minimizing environmental impact, and restoring ecosystems post-extraction. Additionally, UNDP’s Nature Pledge can guide the realignment of investments towards sustainable energy projects, such as developing energy-efficient technologies and promoting sustainable mining through incentive mechanisms."

              "text": "Asian countries, which play a key role in manufacturing technologies like photovoltaic panels and lithium-ion batteries, are highly dependent on critical mineral imports. By applying lifecycle and circular economy principles, such as green design, product re-engineering, and enhanced recycling policies, these regions can reduce reliance on newly mined materials. Effective Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes and improved waste management can also mitigate the environmental impacts of rising e-waste generation. When developed with a focus on social inclusion and gender equality, these initiatives can create decent jobs for women, youth, and marginalized groups, particularly in waste management. As the global energy transition accelerates, demand for minerals essential to electric vehicles, wind turbines, and solar panels is soaring, emphasizing the need for international cooperation. From 2017 to 2022, the energy sector drove a tripling of lithium demand, alongside a 70% increase in cobalt demand and a 40% rise in nickel demand, pushing the market for energy transition minerals to USD 320 billion in 2022 (IEA, 2023)."

Countries like Australia (lithium), Chile (copper and lithium), China (graphite, rare earths), the Democratic Republic of Congo (cobalt), Indonesia (nickel), and South Africa (platinum, iridium) dominate critical mineral extraction. This concentration increases further in the processing stage, with China refining 100% of natural graphite and dysprosium, 70% of cobalt, and nearly 60% of lithium and manganese. Central Asia is also rich in critical minerals, holding 38.6% of the world’s manganese ore, 30% of chromium, 20% of lead, and 12.6% of zinc, among others. Kazakhstan, a major player in uranium production (43% of global supply in 2022), has the potential to compete with China in rare earth elements, as well as the extraction of metals like scandium and yttrium, crucial for technology industries."

Türkiye also possesses key raw materials, including boron, chromium, cobalt, and graphite. While mineral extraction provides economic opportunities, it also poses environmental and social risks, including conflicts between mining companies and local communities. Declining ore grades are increasing resource intensity, generating more waste and raising environmental costs. Mining can contribute to sustainable development by creating jobs and infrastructure, but large-scale activities often result in long-term environmental impacts, such as soil and water pollution, involuntary resettlement, and airborne contamination. As critical minerals are essential for the renewable energy transition, it is crucial to ensure high standards of governance and stakeholder participation throughout the mining lifecycle—from exploration to mine closure. Addressing environmental impacts, protecting human rights, and promoting social inclusion should be priorities. UNDP can support governments in developing regulations that balance environmental protection and economic growth, while capacity-building initiatives can strengthen local authorities’ ability to oversee sustainable mining practices."
