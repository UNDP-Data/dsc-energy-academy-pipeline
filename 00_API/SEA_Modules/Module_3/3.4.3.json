The plan, requiring USD 98 billion, underscored the immense scale of the transition and the financial resources necessary for a truly just transition. Indonesia followed suit at the G20 summit in Bali (November 2022), securing USD 20 billion in JETP financing. The agreement aims to peak power sector emissions by 2030—seven years earlier than planned—and includes ambitious carbon reduction targets."

The partnership aims to accelerate Indonesia's transition from coal to renewable energy, with a commitment to peak power sector emissions by 2030, ahead of the previously planned 2037. This initiative is a collaborative effort, drawing on financial and technical support from international donors and private sector investments. The financial package for Indonesia's JETP is heavily reliant on concessional loans and commercial loans, with grants forming the smallest portion. This structure has faced criticism for being insufficiently different from traditional financing methods, thus not fully addressing the fiscal constraints of a developing economy. The reliance on loans, even if concessional, imposes a debt burden on Indonesia, which could limit its capacity to invest in other critical areas."

The disbursement of funds and the execution of projects have faced significant delays, undermining the credibility of the JETP and raising concerns about its effectiveness. Bureaucratic inertia, lack of coordination among stakeholders, and the complexity of aligning international funding with national priorities are major obstacles to timely and efficient implementation. Moreover, Indonesia’s political landscape poses substantial challenges, with entrenched interests in state-owned enterprises which prefer traditional energy technologies such as hydropower and fossil fuels. These entities resist changes that threaten their economic interests, creating significant barriers to the adoption of renewable energy. There is a significant risk of greenwashing within the JETP framework. In Indonesia, some state-owned companies propose projects that maintain fossil fuel activities while incorporating minor renewable components to enhance their green credentials. Such practices undermine the credibility and effectiveness of the JETP, failing to achieve genuine environmental benefits."

To enhance the effectiveness and impact, JETPs must Increase the proportion of grants and innovative financial instruments discussed earlier and reduce reliance on loans to make the financial packages more attractive and feasible for developing countries. Developing a country platform approach could improve coordination and ownership of JETPs. This approach would involve a nationally owned institutional venue bringing together domestic policymakers, international investors, and technical experts to develop and manage investment plans. It is equally significant to set clear, ambitious targets for emissions reductions and renewable energy adoption, backed by robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks, is crucial. This includes ensuring that the transition plans are aligned with national development goals and international climate commitments."

By offering concessional financing, grants, and technical assistance, JETPs reduce the immediate fiscal pressures on governments, allowing them to reallocate resources towards debt servicing and other critical needs. JETPs can also improve a country’s creditworthiness by promoting sustainable energy projects and reducing reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets. This enhancement in economic stability can lead to lower borrowing costs and better access to international capital markets. For example, South Africa's JETP involves an $8.5 billion financial package from G7 countries aimed at facilitating the transition away from coal, which can ease the country's debt burden by providing alternative funding sources for essential projects."

Stakeholders emphasize the need for seamless integration of JETPs into national strategies and development blueprints, advocating for a harmonious alignment rather than reshaping national agendas to accommodate JETP objectives. Notably concerning is the opacity surrounding JETP governance, with limited public access to crucial information such as the engagement of the International Partners Group (IPG) with recipient nations, resource disbursement, and formal agreements."

Indonesia has established a National Energy Transition Task Force and the JETP Secretariat to coordinate stakeholder engagements and oversee planning and project development. The country’s first coherent energy transition roadmap, the CIPP, with a budget of USD 97 billion, aims to ensure a just and inclusive transition. The framework is built on three key concepts: human rights, gender equality and empowerment, and accountability. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, the establishment of commissions or task forces has proven effective in coordinating just energy transitions. These entities facilitate economic diversification and job creation across sectors like agriculture, tourism, and industry. Without such coordination, unjust transitions—such as direct job losses without reemployment—are a real risk."
