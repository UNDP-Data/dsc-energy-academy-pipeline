              "text": "The current global energy transition marks a pivotal departure from historical shifts, driven not merely by technological advancement but by the existential urgency of climate change. Unlike past transitions—such as the move from biomass to fossil fuels during the Industrial Revolution—today’s shift demands rapid decarbonization, systemic societal transformation, and a reimagining of economic growth paradigms. At its heart, this transition is defined by the imperative to limit global warming to 1.5°C under the Paris Agreement, requiring unprecedented collaboration, innovation, and equity across nations. This lesson explores how the modern energy transition diverges from its predecessors, emphasizing climate mitigation, net-zero frameworks, and the integration of policy and technology. It examines the role of international mechanisms like Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the challenges of bridging gaps between pledges and implementation. Through insights from the IPCC and IEA, the lesson underscores the tension between urgent climate action and slow progress, particularly in balancing the responsibilities of developed and developing nations under the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities."

For example, the industrial revolution's shift from the prevailing wood and biomass energy sources to coal, oil, and more recently, natural gas. Historically, transitions have marked pivotal moments in societal development and global economic systems - they represent significant structural shifts in both supply and consumption patterns. However, the present energy transition presents some important differences from the previous."

              "text": "The impacts of a warming planet are more evident than ever. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—a United Nations body tasked with assessing climate science—warns in its Sixth Assessment Report that failing to drastically reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will severely harm human health, biodiversity, and lead to irreversible ecosystem losses much sooner than anticipated. The path forward is clear: we must immediately and drastically cut emissions while accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy. In 2015, the world united under the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty adopted at COP21. Its goal is to limit global warming to “well below 2°C,” ideally 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this, countries commit to reaching global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible and achieving climate neutrality by 2050. Key tools for meeting these targets are Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Long-Term Strategies (LTS). NDCs are 5-year national climate action plans, while LTS outline 20- to 30-year roadmaps for systemic transformations. These frameworks prioritize scaling up renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE)—cornerstones of the energy transition—by setting binding targets for solar, wind, and other clean technologies, alongside reducing energy demand through innovation and policy."
