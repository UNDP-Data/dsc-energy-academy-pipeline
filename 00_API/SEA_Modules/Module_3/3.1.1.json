              "text": "The current global energy transition marks a pivotal departure from historical shifts, driven not merely by technological advancement but by the existential urgency of climate change. Unlike past transitions—such as the move from biomass to fossil fuels during the Industrial Revolution—today’s shift demands rapid decarbonization, systemic societal transformation, and a reimagining of economic growth paradigms. At its heart, this transition is defined by the imperative to limit global warming to 1.5°C under the Paris Agreement, requiring unprecedented collaboration, innovation, and equity across nations. This lesson explores how the modern energy transition diverges from its predecessors, emphasizing climate mitigation, net-zero frameworks, and the integration of policy and technology. It examines the role of international mechanisms like Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the challenges of bridging gaps between pledges and implementation. Through insights from the IPCC and IEA, the lesson underscores the tension between urgent climate action and slow progress, particularly in balancing the responsibilities of developed and developing nations under the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities."

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—a United Nations body tasked with assessing climate science—warns in its Sixth Assessment Report that failing to drastically reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will severely harm human health, biodiversity, and lead to irreversible ecosystem losses much sooner than anticipated. The path forward is clear: we must immediately and drastically cut emissions while accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy. In 2015, the world united under the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty adopted at COP21. Its goal is to limit global warming to “well below 2°C,” ideally 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this, countries commit to reaching global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible and achieving climate neutrality by 2050. Key tools for meeting these targets are Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Long-Term Strategies (LTS). NDCs are 5-year national climate action plans, while LTS outline 20- to 30-year roadmaps for systemic transformations. These frameworks prioritize scaling up renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE)—cornerstones of the energy transition—by setting binding targets for solar, wind, and other clean technologies, alongside reducing energy demand through innovation and policy."

While carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and direct air capture (DAC) play roles in offsetting emissions from hard-to-abate sectors like heavy industry, comprehensive strategies must also integrate nature-based solutions. These include reforestation, wetland restoration, and sustainable land management, which enhance carbon sinks while protecting biodiversity. Critically, addressing emissions from land use, forestry, and agriculture—which account for nearly 25% of global GHG emissions—is essential to achieving net-zero goals. Practices such as regenerative farming, reducing deforestation, and improving soil health are pivotal, even though these sectors fall outside direct energy system reforms."

Its core objective is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. Under the UNFCCC, developed countries are recognized as having contributed the largest share of historical emissions, with developing countries’ per capita emissions remaining relatively low. However, the Paris Agreement establishes that all countries must work to limit emissions, guided by the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR). This framework places greater mitigation obligations on developed nations, including providing climate finance to support developing countries. Despite these commitments, recent data underscores slow progress. The IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2024 (WEO 2024) highlights that even under the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), current efforts fall short of aligning with the 1.5°C target. The report stresses that existing policies lack both the credibility and urgency needed to close this gap, particularly as global emissions continue to rise. Emerging technologies to offset emissions show potential but remain insufficiently scaled to meet demand."
