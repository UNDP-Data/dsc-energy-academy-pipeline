Renewable energy sources are less water-intensive than conventional sources, which is highly relevant amid water scarcity and erratic flows caused by climate change. The global energy system used 10% of total global freshwater withdrawals in 2021, due to the essential role of water in the energy supply chain, from electricity generation to fossil fuel production (IEA, 2023). The IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario predicts a nearly 15% decline in water use within the power sector due to transitioning from coal to solar PV and wind energy. Replacing off-shore petroleum extraction by renewable energy generated from offshore wind, wave and tidal power farms can contribute to conserving and sustainably using marine resources (SDG 14). Upscaling of renewables will help decrease ocean acidification (via lower carbon emissions), accidental impacts from energy-production and transport activities on aquatic habitats, and marine thermal pollution from cooling at coastal power plants (ICSU, 2017)."

Improving air quality, and by extension human health, is especially important for those living in the dense urban centers of rapidly developing countries (SDG 3). Resilient infrastructure, inclusive industrialization, and innovation (SDG 9) are prerequisites for achieving the SDG 7.2 target. Clean energy systems, in particular, help create the conditions for cities and human settlements to be inclusive, safe, resilient, less-polluting, and more sustainable (SDG 11). An up-scaling of renewable energy can have a large impact on the sustainability of cities and communities. Similarly, achieving SDG 7.2 is key to sustainable urban planning, transport, and housing, since renewable solutions are fundamental pillars of the solutions portfolio. Smart grids and energy communities facilitate the development of renewable energy at the domestic or neighborhood scale. Furthermore, decentralized renewable energy sources enhance resilience. This is exemplified by the City Energy Resilience Framework, developed by the Resilient Cities Network (R-Cities) and Urban Power (Box 8)."

The global renewable energy sector employs 16.2 million people as of 2024, with significant growth in solar PV. Wind and hydropower, as well as liquid biofuels make up most of the rest of the growth in renewable energy jobs. China dominates employment in most renewable energy sectors, however Brazil has the most biofuel jobs (WEF, 2023). While gender parity remains low in the renewable energy sector and technical positions, it is argued that companies with at least 30% female leadership may yield higher profit margins and may be more inclined to invest in sustainability and environmental initiatives (SDGs, 2022). Renewable energy’s value chain presents new opportunities, particularly for women (SDG 5), as greater gender diversity has shown to enhance both effectiveness and financial performance. A just energy transition is essential for equalizing opportunities in employment and leadership roles, emphasizing the importance of access to quality jobs and finance in empowering women and their families (UN Women). Addressing gender gaps in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will help create a more inclusive talent pipeline, enabling more women to access quality jobs and leadership roles in the energy sector. UNDP-supported initiatives in Peru (Box 9) and Yemen (Box 10) showcase women's impact as clean energy promoters."

Yet, mismanaged renewable sources like bioenergy, green hydrogen and hydropower could exacerbate existing water-related issues (ICSU, 2017) (SDG 6). Furthermore, growing water stress in dry regions poses a threat to the power sector regarding energy security, potentially reducing hydropower generation in regions with declining water flows such as southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Variability in hydropower production has worsened the global energy crisis. Reduced hydropower generation in Latin America during 2021 drove up the demand for liquefied natural gas, resulting in early pressure on natural gas prices. Similarly, the significant drop in hydropower output in southern Europe in 2022 compounded the strain on gas and electricity markets due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to cuts in pipeline gas deliveries (IEA, 2023)."

Scaling up bioenergy might clash with efforts to sustainably manage forests, halt deforestation, and protect biodiversity through practices like monocropping for energy crops and large-scale solar installations. Developing agrofuels has historically (e.g. 2005-2011) elevated global food prices due to competition for agricultural resources, impacting affordability and access to food for the vulnerable. Large-scale renewable projects, especially hydroelectric dams, significantly affect land use, disrupting local economies such as agriculture and fishing and aggravating food security. Local land-use changes can scale up impacts at global scale, requiring international coordination and systemic approaches. Multiple land uses and integrated solutions can reduce adverse impacts of renewable energy. Bioenergy’s unique aspect lies in its potential as a land management co-product, supporting ecological services like soil restoration, wildfire prevention, and habitat preservation (SDGs, 2022). Adopting policies that prioritize bioenergy crop growth on degraded lands can mitigate global agricultural market impacts while enhancing soil health and biodiversity (ICSU, 2017). Notably, the “Solar Pyramid” project in Curitiba, Brazil, utilized landfills for solar power plants, supported by C40’s network, a coalition of mayors fighting climate change (Box 11). Emerging technologies like agrivoltaics serve as innovative integrated land-use systems, enabling simultaneous production of food, electricity, and water (FAO, 2021; EU Science Hub, 2023), as exemplified by the Indian case study (Box 12). More on this topic in Module 6."

              "text": "Renewable energies' impact on water resources (SDG 14) and (SDG 15) land footprints extend across their entire value chain. The extraction of minerals necessary for manufacturing renewable components like solar, wind, and batteries, coupled with challenges in end-of-life recycling, shapes their sustainability. Global battery storage capacity grew by 136% in 2023 compared to 2022, and this upward trend is expected to continue. By 2030, battery storage capacity is expected to grow tenfold. Materials essential for EV batteries and energy storage systems (like lithium, cobalt, and nickel)— are expanding alongside the low-carbon technology shift, now comprising up to 5% of metals and mining revenues. More on critical minerals value chain and their environmental and social implications in Modules 3 and 6. Further, subterranean footprints from drilling boreholes or fracking can affect water aquifers and geological formations. Evaluating their environmental footprint mandates a comprehensive assessment of land impacts, considering the entire life cycle, from fuel extraction to decommissioning. Notably, a single energy technology can vary significantly in its land footprint. For example, solar panels made from cadmium have a smaller land footprint compared to silicon panels (Our World in Data, 2022). These environmental impacts, including mining materials and energy consumption during refining processes, underscore the critical role of deployment choices and technological considerations as well as of public consultation and participatory environmental impact assessments."

              "text": "The pursuit of critical energy transition materials can help drive attention toward sustainable socioeconomic growth. Renewable energy manufacturing Initiatives can bolster local manufacturing and create jobs, but can also contribute to environmental harm and exploitation of workers and communities (SDG 8). Efforts to secure these resources through export bans and industry nationalization align with national economic interests but require comprehensive approaches that uphold community rights, labor rights, and environmental sustainability (IRENA, 2023). Moreover, large-scale renewable energy projects, such as hydropower dams or bioenergy, can disrupt traditional land management, impact community cohesion and violate legitimate land tenure rights (SDG 1). Documented human rights abuses, including threats, land grabs and harm to indigenous communities, highlight the need for establishing clear policies to protect human rights, involving stakeholders, and providing accessible redress mechanisms in renewable energy projects (OHCHR, 2016) (CCSI, 2023). For instance, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights outline steps companies must take to respect human rights and provide remedies for harms their operations cause or contribute to (Amnesty, 2023). Additional Resource: A socio-economic footprint analysis of the energy transition performed by IRENA in South Africa and Egypt, enhance the comprehensive assessment of renewable energy potential impacts on environment, people and livelihoods protection and jobs creation (Box 13)."
