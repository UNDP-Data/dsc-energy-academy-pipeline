It is the backbone of modern life, essential for delivering critical social services such as healthcare, education, water supply, heating, and cooling. But energy is not just about convenience—it shapes living standards, economic opportunity, public safety, and resilience. Yet access alone is not enough. Today, 1.18 billion people live in energy poverty, lacking the adequate, reliable, and affordable energy needed for lighting, cooking, communication, and daily life. To unlock human potential and drive sustainable development, we need energy systems that are not only available—but reliable, inclusive, and resilient—systems that uphold basic rights, enable access to clean water and sanitation, and strengthen community safety and well-being."

For example, moving from a range of 1-5 gigajoules* to just 10 gigajoules per capita can shift a country from low to medium development. However, as development increases, additional energy use has diminishing returns, with smaller improvements in HDI at higher levels of energy consumption. While the relationship falls apart at very high levels of HDI, understanding this connection is crucial for sustainable growth. *A gigajoule (GJ) is a unit of energy. One gigajoule is equal to one billion joules. To put it in perspective, 1 GJ is roughly equivalent to: 278 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity 26 liters of gasoline For context, 278 kWh of electricity is about three times less than the average monthly household consumption in the U.S. (875 kWh per month) (EIA, 2024). Alternatively, this is roughly the monthly consumption of a small energy-efficient freezer, which uses around 39 kWh per month (Silicon Valley Power, 2024)."

However, this pursuit of economic growth, especially through increased fossil fuel consumption, often comes at a cost to the environment. The energy trilemma—balancing energy security, equity, and sustainability—captures these complex trade-offs between energy production, economic advancement, and state of environment. This trilemma is not just an abstract concept; it is deeply intertwined with issues of fairness and equity. Developing countries and regions reliant on fossil fuels often face a difficult balancing act: ensuring affordable and reliable energy access (security), promoting economic growth (equity), and advancing environmental protection (sustainability). In this chapter, we will break down the key aspects of this trilemma, examining how different countries navigate these challenges and what strategies can help achieve a more sustainable energy future."

An average American, for example, uses 12 times more energy than an average Indian—consuming in one month what an Indian uses in an entire year. The gap is even wider between North America and Africa, where the average North American consumes over 50 times more energy than the average African. Even among middle-income countries, stark contrasts remain: the average Briton uses twice as much energy as the average Brazilian.

In 2019, about 33% of the energy produced globally was lost before even reaching consumers, due to production and transportation inefficiencies. Another 30% was wasted on the demand side, as energy was converted into useful energy (see Figure 7). More specifically, most energy losses come from inefficiencies in fossil fuel production and delivery (177 EJ/year), transportation (19 EJ/year), and usage (183 EJ/year). Fossil fuel power plants and internal combustion engines account for nearly half of global energy waste, alongside significant losses from the underutilization of byproducts and waste heat. Wasting 379 EJ of energy each year results in a loss of approximately $4.6 trillion globally—$1 trillion on the supply side and $3.6 trillion on the demand side. This equates to 40% of global energy spending and 5% of global GDP, which is roughly double the annual investments in the energy system."

Many major fossil fuel-exporting countries often face political instability, which can disrupt the supply of oil, gas, and coal. For low-income countries that rely heavily on fuel imports, these disruptions can lead to energy shortages, economic stress, and reduced access to basic services. Fossil fuels also depend on complex supply chains—pipelines, shipping routes, and refineries—that are vulnerable to conflicts, accidents, and natural disasters. In addition, global events such as wars, natural disasters, sanctions, or economic crises can cause energy prices to fluctuate, making them unpredictable. For resource-rich but low-income nations, fossil fuel exports can provide economic stability, yet they also expose them to market volatility and the \"resource curse,\" where wealth from fuel exports does not translate into broader economic development. This volatility strains international relations as countries compete to secure affordable energy supplies. Moreover, producing fossil fuels does not always guarantee energy security for a country, and it can lead to unequal distribution of resources, where not all citizens benefit equally from the profits or energy generated. In short, fossil fuels present significant risks to a stable and secure energy supply, largely due to external geopolitical and economic factors."
