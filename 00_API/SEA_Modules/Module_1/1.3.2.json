CBA helps policymakers and stakeholders make informed decisions by comparing the direct and indirect costs of energy transition initiatives such as the development of renewable energy infrastructure, grid modernization, or energy efficiency programs against the anticipated benefits. These benefits include not only financial returns but also broader societal advantages, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, energy security, and job creation in the green economy. In energy transition projects, environmental considerations such as emissions reductions, resource conservation, and ecosystem impacts are often central to CBA. This is where integrating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) becomes invaluable."

This approach promotes integrated solutions aligned with sustainable development goals, emphasizing efficient resource use and stakeholder dialogue for policy coherence across sectors and governments. Employing a decision-making framework grounded in systems thinking, it identifies cross-sectorial impacts, explores trade-offs, and guides development pathways towards resource efficiency, equity, and sustainability at various governance levels. Its versatility spans the project cycle, aiding in planning, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Stakeholder dialogues, scenarios, and response options drive this approach, facilitating integrated planning, decision-making, and cost-effective implementation. Methods range from qualitative indicators-based approaches to operational systems, chosen based on data availability, scale of impacts, stakeholder involvement, and communication needs. This assessment process enhances understanding of sector interactions, leading to optimal solutions feeding into policy dialogues, contingent on contextual factors, capacities, and constructive dialogues. Advantages include its ability to address interconnected challenges, develop comprehensive policy responses, and create integrated policies and practices addressing crosscutting challenges for both immediate needs and long-term goals. This approach leverages co-benefits, enhances resource productivity, resilience, and policy coherence, stimulating investments in sustainable infrastructure and ecosystem preservation (UNSGAB, 2014) (UNFCCC, 2015) (UNESCO, 2021) (SDG Asia Pacific, 2023) (UN et al., 2023) (Nexus, 2020)."

The Pact for the Future, presented at the Summit of the Future, will further guide us towards these targets. Meeting these bold commitments demands bold actions, and achieving them will be challenging without leveraging the triptych of digital innovation, data, and AI. These are powerful tools to speed up the energy transition, helping to identify the best investment opportunities, guiding smart decision-making, and driving breakthroughs in renewable energy. In fact, if scaled effectively, digital technologies could reduce emissions by 20% by 2050 in the energy, materials, and mobility sectors — the three largest contributors to global emissions. In other words, digital innovation could be the ‘low-hanging fruit’ that can offer a fast, cost-effective way to accelerate the energy transition. But creating digital tools is only part of the solution; we need to ensure that data-driven policies translate into real-world impact. The energy transition value chain is producing a vast amount of data, which must be leveraged to respond to the socio-economic implications and environmental challenges of the transition. The true value of data lies in how well we use them to reveal integrated opportunities for sustainable energy development and ensure a just energy transition. However, without robust regulatory and institutional frameworks, these changes cannot be fully realized. More about data, diigital and AI for energy transition in Module 7."

Their SDG Push Diagnostic offers reports from 94 countries, presenting development landscapes and policy choices made within fiscal constraints. This dynamic visualization tool integrates multiple data sources to analyze SDG trends, national priorities, and interlinkages, outlining potential pathways beyond 2030. It provides insights into challenges, growth trajectories, environmental sustainability, and inclusiveness (SDG Moment), aligns national priorities with SDGs using machine learning (Trends & Priorities), maps synergies and trade-offs for policy pathways (SDG Interlinkages), and offers fiscal insights and stimulus options for progress acceleration (Finance & Stimulus). This comprehensive approach leverages data, AI, and systems intelligence to support countries in accelerating progress toward the SDGs. 🔗Tool's website"
