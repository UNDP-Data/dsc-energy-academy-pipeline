It assesses progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for everyone by 2030, while also exploring the critical interlinkages between with other SDGs. The module seeks to equip readers with approaches, methods and tools for SDG7 acceleration and innovation. Further, this module will outline the objectives and content of the Sustainable Energy Academy and present the approach of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to achieving the global sustainable energy transition through its Energy Moonshot flagship"
