              "text": "Welcome to the Sustainable Energy Academy — where you will explore how energy catalyzes development, drives global transformation and unlocks innovation. As the world faces growing inequalities, a changing climate, and rising energy demands, the transition to inclusive and clean energy systems has never been more urgent—or more full of possibility. By 2030, clean energy investments could generate 30 million green jobs. In Sub-Saharan Africa, solar-powered irrigation could meet one-third of smallholder farms’ water needs. And across the Global South, sustainable energy can power essential health services for the 685 people still living without access to electricity. Sustainable energy is more than just electricity — it is the fundamental lever of development. From powering schools and hospitals to enabling digital inclusion, economic growth, and climate resilience, sustainable energy is a key driver of human progress. This is more than a course. It’s a call to action. Join us in shaping a future where sustainable energy can fueling progress, prosperity, and opportunity to leave no one behind"

It provides a comprehensive overview of energy within the global development agenda, laying the foundation to understand how access to sustainable energy is deeply interconnected with solutions to climate change, poverty, and inequality. Through the lens of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7), the module examines current progress, gaps, and pathways to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy by 2030. You'll explore energy's powerful linkages with other SDGs and gain access to tools, methods, and innovations that can help accelerate real-world action. The module also introduces the vision and structure of the Sustainable Energy Academy, and the role of UNDP’s Energy Moonshot in driving systemic transformation across countries and communities."
