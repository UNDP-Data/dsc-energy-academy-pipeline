              "text": "Since the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was conceived to be integrated and indivisible, the SDGs are interlinked and interdependent by design. SDG Interlinkages refer to the complex network of interconnections among goals, targets and indicators. Actions toward one SDG can have positive or negative impacts on others, varying across geographical and temporal scales. Understanding this complexity and the directionality of change is key for achieving the Agenda goals while safeguarding against negative feedback loops/externalities. Such an approach facilitates the creation of integrated solutions that drive simultaneous progress across multiple SDGs by maximizing synergies and minimizing trade-offs, which aids in optimizing resources and accelerating response times. However, solutions are not one-size-fits-all; they demand tailored approaches aligned with national priorities. This chapter aims to empower participants as change-makers and leaders in innovative sustainable development solutions, fostering multiple SDG achievements within energy initiatives. The lessons elucidate the complex relationship between electricity access and clean cooking (SDG 7.1), renewable energy (SDG 7.2) and energy efficiency (SDG 7.3) and other SDGs."
