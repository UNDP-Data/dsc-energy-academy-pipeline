Create an interactive platform for technical knowledge and expertise sharing The Energy Academy aims to serve as a vibrant and collaborative platform for technical knowledge and expertise sharing among countries. Through interactive modules, live webinars, discussion forums, and resource libraries, policymakers, government officials, and stakeholders will have access to a wealth of information, best practices, and case studies. This collaborative environment aims to foster cross-learning, facilitate peer-to-peer exchanges, and strengthen countries’ collective capacity to address energy-related challenges."

This three-tiered approach emulates the UNDP’s SURGE Academy* and the SDG Finance Academy**, which have both been proven to be successful. Learning is no longer only delivered online and one-off training is not seen as sufficient to achieve learning outcomes. Instead, it requires ongoing delivery over a more extended period, community engagement, learning from other people and experiences, and clear use of case studies for application, as well as continual updating and adjusting. * The SURGE Academy learning path prepares expert UNDP staff for rapid response deployments to country offices in the immediate aftermath of disaster, conflict, or shock. ** The SDG Finance Academy brings UNDP’s sustainable finance knowledge to the world by building a community of experts to join in marshaling public and private finance for the SDGs."
