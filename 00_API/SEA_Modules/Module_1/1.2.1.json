Electricity enables rural populations to store and refrigerate medicines and vaccines, ensuring community health. It powers vital medical devices, lighting and communications. Furthermore, the lack of reliable energy contributes to indoor air pollution, as many rely on biomass or kerosene for cooking and lighting, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, particularly affecting women and children. Electricity is also key for improving household health conditions, through clean indoor environments, cooking facilities, and thermal comfort (heating and cooling). Energy also contributes to expanding water and sanitation services (SDG 6), particularly in water-stressed regions. Energy also contributes to expanding water and sanitation services (SDG 6), particularly in water-stressed regions. Decentralized solar PV water pumps can replace more expensive diesel pumps, and mini-grids can power filtration technologies, such as reverse osmosis systems, to produce clean drinking water (IEA, 2023), powering a shift toward unconventional water supply options (e.g., desalination). Electricity is essential in health facilities, powering medical devices, refrigeration for vaccines, and providing access to clean water and sanitation, which are vital for public health. Solar PV systems and solar pumps installed by UNICEF (Box 1) have been used successfully in healthcare facilities to improve access to safe water and hygienic sanitation."

This enhances food crop yields, diversifies regional diets, contributes to income generation (SDG 2 and SDG 8) and strengthens food security. The World Bank Group projects that by 2030, two-thirds of the world’s extreme poor will live in fragile, conflict and violence settings. As a result, achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 10 (Reduce Inequalities) demands innovative and integrated solutions.

              "text": "Indoor air pollution is estimated to cause around 13 deaths per minute, mostly affecting women and girls who shoulder household responsibilities and face exposure to polluting lighting and cooking methods (SDG 3 and SDG 5). Women and girls are believed, in some regions, to be spending up to 18 hours weekly on wood gathering and household cooking (UNDP, 2022). Therefore, access to clean energy directly aids in reducing women's time poverty, for instance thanks to equipment such as fridges and washing machines, better educational attendance is attained. Access to energy fundamentally equates to access to opportunity. Yet, unless progress accelerates, by 2030 an estimated 341 million women and girls will still lack electricity. Studies indicate a 9 to 23% increase in women's employment post-electrification (UN, 2022). Public outdoor lighting increases security for women and girls, allowing more autonomy after dark and reducing exposure to gender-based violence. Similarly, information technologies and the Internet can help reduce the digital divide and foster digital inclusion for women and girls (WEF, 2023; ITU, 2020). Empowered women are more likely to drive local initiatives benefiting from cleaner cooking and lighting, which directly impacts their lives and families. UNDP’s integrated projects in India and Nepal have shown promising results toward energy access, women’s equality and productive opportunities development (Box 3). UN Women's efforts in Ethiopia, included interest-free loans and entrepreneurship training benefiting over 19,500 women, enabling them to invest in an energy-saving cooking stove cooperative (Box 4). It is essential to recognize that women are not just beneficiaries of sustainable energy solutions, but are critical actors and leaders in the energy transition. Women comprise 40% of the solar PV workforce, nearly double their participation in the oil and gas sectors of only 22%. Similarly, the clean cooking sector offers unique opportunities, as women represent half of managers in both bioethanol and electricity-powered cooking. Supporting women through investments and inclusive policies is therefore crucial, acknowledging their exceptional resilience and determination in breaking barriers and overcoming gender biases."

Energy sufficiency and affordability pose challenges in transitioning to clean energy technologies, potentially leading to a return to polluting energy sources. A similar dilemma arises in clean cooking: high upfront costs and unreliable LPG supply hinder rural communities from abandoning biomass (UCL, 2021). For instance, unconventional water supply options such as desalination are highly energy-intensive (ICSU, 2017), and this demand for energy can inadvertently exacerbate resource depletion. Similarly, certain agricultural practices that rely on energy-intensive technologies could also lead to unsustainable water use or land degradation. To mitigate these rebound effects, strategies such as energy sufficiency (ensuring that energy is used efficiently without waste), affordability mechanisms (making energy solutions financially accessible without overconsumption) and capacity-building (educating and training communities on sustainable energy use and conservation) have shown promise. (WBG, 2017; WLPGA, 2018). Box 5 provides an example of a project in Somalia that addressed multiple issues by bolstering sustainable energy security and livelihoods at the same time."

              "text": "Renewable-based energy access solutions, such as solar or wind, heavily rely on batteries to overcome natural resources’ intermittence. However, mining, manufacturing, inappropriate maintenance and disposal of batteries can lead to pollution, impacting human health (SDG 3) and ecosystems (SDG 14-15) as well as present social risks. With the demand for batteries going up in recent years, effective waste management is becoming increasingly important. Stakeholders and companies must prioritize a robust commitment to proper battery management, covering maintenance, security standards, and disposal. E-waste regulation planning is becoming integral to operational plans, fostering innovation and strategic partnerships, especially in regions lacking e-waste infrastructure. For example, only a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa (including Rwanda, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa), have e-waste management facilities, equipped for off-grid solar value-chain recycling, and cross-boundary movement is expensive and complex. The scarcity of e-waste management facilities capable of handling end-of-life products from off-grid solar requires immediate attention and action (Lighting Global, 2022). The Global Battery Alliance (GBA) (Box 6) has emerged to tackle these challenges. In their recent report, Off-Grid Solar Market Trends Report 2022: State of the Sector, the Alliance highlights the need for pilot projects aimed at launching and scaling effective corporate reverse logistics programs. Additionally, GBA advocates for establishing traceability and disclosure systems to address these critical issues."

This alliance focuses on Action Partnerships, tackling critical areas like establishing global criteria for sustainable batteries, ensuring responsible sourcing of materials, and promoting energy access in emerging economies while emphasizing circular practices to reduce lead poisoning and environmental impacts (source: GBA). In parallel, the surge in critical mineral demand raises pressing concerns about fairness and sustainability, including the environmental impacts of land degradation, water scarcity, and the well-being of local communities. To address these challenges, the UN Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals’ guide —Resourcing the Energy Transition— calls for justice and equity to anchor this transition. A truly sustainable energy future must balance technological progress with social and ecological responsibility, ensuring that communities and ecosystems are protected throughout this critical shift."

              "text": "Remote communities lacking grid access, marked by low population density, low-income levels, challenging terrains, and poor infrastructure, confront significant hurdles in accessing electricity. These communities can be grouped into three categories: geographically remote regions like rural settings, mountainous areas, small islands, and deep forests; communities with a remote chance of gaining grid access, including displaced refugees due to conflict or natural disasters; and those fully dependent on off-grid energy with minimal demand profiles, such as Indigenous communities. Despite varying characteristics, these settlements share commonalities in low electricity access, economic and energy poverty, and the difficulty of obtaining grid-based electricity supply (IRENA, 2023). The diverse profile of last-mile communities necessitates community-centric models to ensure tailored solutions that fit their unique characteristics and needs. For example, successful and inclusive projects in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region (Box 7) showcase effective approaches addressing the challenges of last-mile regions (HIMAP, 2019; ADB, 2023)."

              "text": "Social norms and gender roles can hinder women from benefiting equally from energy access initiatives, discourage them from participating in the sector’s labor force, and impacting their inclusion in decision-making processes. Gender-blind initiatives counteract women's equality, worsening gender gaps in energy poverty (SDG Action, 2023). Affordability mechanisms that neglect women deepen dependency, as they often receive lower salaries and depend on men's income. The focus should be on how access to electricity reduces the amount of time women and girls spend on unpaid domestic work, or time poverty, freeing up time for income-generating activities or education, thus enhancing their empowerment and economic opportunities. Women are particularly vulnerable in conflict, disaster, and emergency settings, with millions forcibly displaced, lacking access to modern lighting and facing risks like violence and fuel-related challenges. The lack of gender-responsive training for off-grid systems can lead to the exclusion of women, reinforcing gender inequalities. The creation of an enabling environment for women's participation in the energy sector requires gender-responsive planning, policymaking, regulation, and progress tracking through gender-disaggregated data collection and analysis (UN, 2021). Providing access to STEM education for women and girls is crucial, enabling them to compete for jobs in the renewable energy sector and become active participants and agents of change. This approach can lead to improvements in clean energy access deployment and management."
