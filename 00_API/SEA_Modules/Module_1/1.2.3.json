For instance, shifting dietary patterns towards water-intensive foods, coupled with an anticipated population surge to over 9 billion by 2050, could necessitate a staggering 50% increase in global food production. Integrated and efficient management of water, food, and energy presents synergistic opportunities to address these multiple challenges. Optimizing power plant operations, deploying advanced cooling systems, and embracing energy-efficient irrigation present viable solutions. Water services, acting as a cornerstone for demand-side energy management, offer opportunities for power generation and storage, with irrigation adjustments during low electricity demand periods and reduced pumping during peaks (IEA, 2023). The intertwined nature of land, soil, and water systems calls for comprehensive efficiency measures across the agri-food chain. Precision irrigation guided by water providers' data and the safeguarding of ecosystems alongside agricultural and energy production are novel solutions to ensure environmental sustainability (UN Water, 2023). Efficient cold chain solutions are also key for supporting food security while reducing food waste (FAO, 2021)."

Developing nations have immense potential to adopt Industry 4.0 in manufacturing, employing smart production tools like real-time analytics, automation, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligences (AI) to enhance productivity and minimize environmental impact (UN, 2022). Agriculture 4.0, which leverages precision farming, autonomous machinery, AI-driven monitoring, and IoT-enabled smart irrigation, is also emerging for enhanced farming practices. Agricultural automation trends include creating specialized equipment for farming tasks and converting standard machinery into autonomous systems (FAO, 2020). Smart cities and grids, driven by digital tech, optimize urban infrastructure and energy networks. UNDP-supported projects in places like Mauritius to introduce smart grid solutions that automate responses to outages and improve reliability and power quality. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, digital tech monitors and reduces building power consumption, critical for emissions reduction. Tracking energy use and emissions in 75% of buildings aids in efficient planning and disaster mitigation ( Box 15) (UNDP, 2023).

              "text": "Nature-based solutions (NBS) stand as a promising avenue for scaling up energy efficiency by leveraging ecosystems to regulate temperatures, enhance insulation, and reduce energy demand in buildings and infrastructure. For instance, urban green infrastructure, such as green roofs and tree-lined streets, lowers cooling costs by mitigating the urban heat island effect, while wetland restoration can enhance water retention and reduce the energy needed for water treatment and distribution. In agriculture, agroforestry and regenerative farming improve soil moisture retention, reducing irrigation-related energy consumption. However, the substantial land requirements of large-scale nature-based solutions, especially for climate change mitigation (i.e. carbon capture solutions), require simultaneous actions to ease land pressure, such as shifts in food systems and agriculture, to prevent potential conflicts. Inclusive design becomes critical considering the historical impact on marginalized communities amid land and climate changes. Challenges to wider adoption include limitations in ecosystem services, monitoring difficulties, and varying societal perceptions of climate risks (WWF, 2020). Mitigating potential trade-offs and avoiding exacerbating climate issues and social injustices require integrated, bottom-up approaches. UNDP's initiatives, particularly in tackling deforestation through nature-based solutions, exemplify this comprehensive strategy (Box 17)."

Creating widespread awareness and understanding among governments, industries, and communities is paramount for an initiative’s success (WEF, 2023). While technology is essential, influencing consumer behavior significantly impacts energy savings. For instance, smart metering and real-time feedback systems have been shown to reduce household energy consumption by 5-15%. Behavioral approaches can reshape energy efficiency programs by integrating social norms, incentives, and nudging techniques. An example is the \"Cool Biz\" campaign in Japan, which encourages businesses to relax dress codes and reduce air conditioning use, has saved an estimated 1.4 million tons of CO₂ emissions annually. In India, the Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) program leveraged bulk procurement and behavioral campaigns to distribute over 360 million LED bulbs, reducing annual electricity consumption by 47 billion kWh. Successful energy efficiency initiatives require a mix of technology-driven solutions and a deep, contextual understanding of human behavior. This emphasizes tailored, cost-effective approaches, continual evaluation, and engagement with communication experts in crafting effective behavior change campaigns. Behavioral approaches can reshape energy efficiency programs, focusing on behavior change and gender equality. These programs need to consider local contexts and consumer data, possibly integrating them into broader interventions (UNDP, 2024; ESMAP, 2020)."

Overcoming challenges involves inclusive capacity-building efforts across sectors, focusing on individuals regardless of age or gender, particularly targeting women and youth (SDG 5) (FAO, 2020). Beyond education and behavior change, financing mechanisms play a crucial role in scaling energy efficiency. Governments and financial institutions have introduced innovative financing models such as green loans, energy service companies (ESCOs), and on-bill financing to encourage businesses and households to invest in energy-efficient solutions.
