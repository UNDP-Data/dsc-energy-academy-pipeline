Renewable energy refers to energy sources that come from resources that are replenishable, such as wind or solar power. Sustainable energy, however, goes further, addressing efficiency, responsibility to future generations, and universal access to energy. Combining these concepts—renewable and sustainable energy—can help us create an energy model that is both forward-thinking and fair."

At the heart of 2030 agenda lies Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7): Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. SDG7 highlights the critical role energy plays in fighting poverty, reducing inequality, and tackling climate change. The world has made significant strides toward sustainable energy targets. Since 2015, the number of people without electricity has dropped from 958 million to 685 million, and those without access to clean cooking fuels fell from 2.8 billion to 2.1 billion. Renewable energy capacity is expanding rapidly, with growth expected to continue at an unprecedented pace. Yet, progress remains uneven and too slow to meet global targets. By 2030, 660 million people are still projected to lack electricity, and 1.7 billion could remain without access to clean cooking solutions if current trends persist. These challenges highlight the urgent need for action, especially as energy systems face growing pressure to align with the Paris Agreement.* *The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, France, in 2015. Its overarching goal is to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.”"

              "text": "At COP28, the UAE Consensus reaffirmed global commitments to accelerate the energy transition, including tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030. The agreement also marked the first explicit call for transitioning away from fossil fuels, underscoring the urgency of shifting to cleaner energy systems. Meeting the global target of tripling renewable capacity by 2030, reinforced at COP28*, will require an additional 5,500 GW of capacity to be constructed by the end of the decade, according to the IEA. Electricity is driving the global shift to renewables, while progress in heating and transport remains slower. The share of renewables in total final energy consumption increased from 16.7% in 2015 to 18.7% in 2021. The electricity sector has seen major gains, driven by falling costs for wind and solar power. By 2021, renewables made up 28.2% of electricity consumption, rising from 22.9% in 2015. * COP28, or the 28th Conference of the Parties, was the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference."

              "text": "Global gains in renewable energy have been impressive, with per capita installed capacity for renewable electricity nearly doubling from 250 watts in 2015 to 424 watts in 2022. Over the past five years, the sector achieved an unprecedented annual growth rate of 8.1%. But this progress is not shared equally. In 2022, Least Developed Countries (LDCs) reached just 40 watts per capita, while Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) achieved 103 and 101 watts, respectively. At their current pace, it would take LDCs 41 years, LLDCs 38 years, and SIDS 11 years to match where developing countries are today. This stark disparity highlights the urgent need to accelerate efforts and ensure equitable access to sustainable energy worldwide. This disparity stems from limited investment, high capital costs, weaker grid infrastructure, and challenges in accessing finance—all of which hinder renewable energy deployment in many developing economies. More on how to overcome these challenges in the upcoming modules."

              "text": "Despite commitments through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS), the current efforts are not enough to meet the 1.5°C target. If all pledges made in the run up to COP28 were fully implemented, CO2 emissions would drop by just 1.4 gigatonnes (GtCO2) by 2030 and 2.3 GtCO2 by 2050. This still leaves a gap of 18 GtCO2 to close by mid-century. At this rate, global energy-related emissions would reach 35.2 GtCO2 in 2030—far above the 23 GtCO2 required under the 1.5°C pathway outlined by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Current pledges could cut emissions by 3% by 2030 and 51% by 2050 compared to 2022 levels. While this represents some progress, it falls well short of what is needed to keep global warming within safe limits. However, this outlook may change, as countries are set to update their NDCs by COP30. The upcoming revisions could strengthen 2030 and 2050 targets, potentially closing some of the emissions gap."

However, achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius or less, requires unprecedented change in how we do things. Yet, as history has shown, abrupt change can incur a hefty price on workers and society. As these shifts unfold, momentum is growing around the concept of a just transition, focused on both workforce impacts and broader environmental and social justice concerns. A just transition means greening the economy in a way that is as fair and inclusive as possible to everyone concerned, creating decent work opportunities and leaving no one behind. A just transition involves maximizing the social and economic opportunities of climate action, while minimizing and carefully managing any challenges – including through effective social dialogue among all groups impacted, and respect for fundamental labour principles and rights.

It seeks to balance the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions with the responsibility of equitably distributing the benefits and burdens of this transition. Special attention is given to vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as low-income communities, Indigenous Peoples—whose land rights and traditional practices are often at stake—women, and workers in carbon-intensive industries, who might otherwise be disproportionately affected. By embedding principles of fairness and equity, a just energy transition supports livelihoods, fosters social cohesion, and ensures that no one is left behind in the journey toward a sustainable future. Promisingly, momentum around “just transition” is gathering pace. We are seeing it emerge in the global dialogue around decarbonization and net zero. More countries are referencing it in their short and long-term climate plans. Partners are coming together, and coalitions are forming. More on just energy transitions in Module 3."
