              "text": "Energy plays a critical role in achieving a high quality of life and realizing the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals.. Even modest increases in energy access can dramatically improve living standards, especially in developing nations. To understand how energy shapes our world, this chapter introduces a visual map of global energy flows, showing how energy moves from sources like fossil fuels and renewables to the sectors that depend on them. At the heart of the chapter is the ‘energy trilemma (security, equity, sustainability)’—the delicate balance between fueling economic growth and protecting the environment. As global energy demand surges, fossil fuel consumption continues to rise, widening the gap between countries with abundant resources and those struggling with access. This imbalance has serious consequences, particularly in accelerating climate change, with energy use responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. The path forward is sustainable energy. Recognizing this urgency, COP28 set a global goal to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030 as key steps toward achieving the Paris Agreement targets. According to the IEA, reaching this goal would require an additional 5,500 GW of renewable energy capacity worldwide. By unraveling these interconnected issues, this chapter lays the groundwork for understanding how energy systems work and why transitioning to sustainable energy is crucial for our shared future."
