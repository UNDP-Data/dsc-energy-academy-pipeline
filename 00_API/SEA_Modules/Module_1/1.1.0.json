              "text": "Energy plays a critical role in achieving a high quality of life and realizing the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals, underpinning essential services from healthcare and education to livelihoods and modern infrastructure. This chapter presents a visual map of global energy flows, showing how energy moves from sources like fossil fuels and renewables to the sectors that depend on them. This visualization highlights the complexities and inefficiencies within current energy systems, emphasizing the need for a more integrated and sustainable approach. Central to this discussion is the energy trilemma: balancing energy security, equity, and environmental sustainability. As global energy demand continues to rise, reliance on fossil fuels exacerbates climate change. Emissions already in the atmosphere could reduce global GDP per capita by up to 29% by 2050, hitting the most vulnerable countries hardest. The path forward is sustainable energy. Only by designing adaptive, diversified, and inclusive energy systems can we protect communities, drive development, and achieve climate goals in a rapidly changing world. Recognizing this urgency, COP28 set a global goal to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030 as key steps toward meeting the Paris Agreement targets. According to the IEA, reaching this goal would require an additional 5,500 GW of renewable energy capacity worldwide. By unpacking these interconnected issues, this chapter lays the groundwork for understanding how energy systems functionâ€”and why transitioning to sustainable energy is essential for our shared future."
