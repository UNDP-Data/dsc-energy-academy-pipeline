Data can help build a complete picture of the issue and identify the root cause. It can help spot the gaps and potential areas that could be improved. Also, data can provide evidence of successful policies in other places, so policymakers can have a benchmark they can observe, modify, and apply in the context of the scope under their authority. Data can support the model and analyse different strategies by quantifying the costs, risks, and benefits. This analysis is necessary to ensure the policy options are the least cost and the most impactful. Data can guide policymakers in picking the fittest policy by quantifying the costs and benefits. It can also identify the risks that might appear so policymakers can minimize those risks by formulating and applying some strategies based on existing data indicators. \n \nIn the second stage, monitoring, policymakers can track the progress of their goals and objectives from data. Through data analysis, they can identify trends and patterns that can strengthen or weaken the policy for achieving goals. \n\nStakeholders can also evaluate the effectiveness of the policy implementation by comparing the actual and expected outcomes. In addition to that, data can also inform the public about the progress of such policy implementation, so the public can actively participate in monitoring the progress and giving feedback to policymakers. Ultimately, data can establish a mechanism for development in the energy sector that can improve the performance of policies through monitoring systems. \n </h3><h6>Results-based management life-cycle approach</h6>",

Energy data serves as a fundamental tool in this process, offering insights into the tangible effects of various interventions on energy consumption, emissions reduction, and overall sustainability. By harnessing the power of energy data, stakeholders can assess the environmental, social, and economic impacts of energy-related activities, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning. \n \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment \nOne of the primary areas where energy data is instrumental in impact measurement is environmental assessment. Through the analysis of energy consumption patterns, emissions data, and resource utilization, stakeholders can quantify the environmental impact of energy production, distribution, and consumption. This includes assessing carbon emissions, air and water pollution levels, and the depletion of natural resources. Energy data enables stakeholders to track progress towards environmental targets, identify areas for improvement, and implement mitigation strategies to minimize negative environmental impacts. \n \nSocial and Economic Impact Analysis \nIn addition to environmental considerations, energy data also facilitates the assessment of social and economic impacts. By analysing energy access, affordability, and reliability metrics, stakeholders can evaluate the socio-economic implications of energy policies and programs. This includes assessing the impact on energy access for marginalized communities, the affordability of energy services, and the creation of employment opportunities in the renewable energy sector.

Through detailed data analysis, policymakers and development organizations can design targeted interventions and allocate resources effectively to expand energy access to marginalized populations.  \n \nThe Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) initiative was launched by ESMAP in 2015 to redefine what is measured to assess energy access and how that is analysed to inform policy making. Unlike traditional approaches, the MTF redefines the metrics used to evaluate energy access and introduces a nuanced analysis framework. At its core, the MTF categorizes levels of electricity access into tiers, each representing distinct dimensions such as capacity, availability, reliability, affordability, quality, formality, and health & safety7. By disaggregating electricity access in this manner, the MTF provides a comprehensive understanding of the varied facets of energy provision, going beyond mere binary assessments of access or lack thereof.  </h3><h6>Key areas of decision-making where data can make a difference</h6>",
