But what does this term truly mean beyond emission reduction? A just energy transition is more than a climate imperative; it is a moral and social responsibility that demands our attention. \n\nThis transition must holistically address climate mitigation and adaptation, ensuring that the social and gender dimensions are central to the process. The real challenge lies as much in how we decarbonize as in determining who benefits from this transformation and who bears its costs.\r\n\r\nFirst chapter of this module explores the concept of a just energy transition in the context of other energy transitions. It then reviews the concept's roots, potential and main challenges. Further on in this lesson, you will have the opportunity to explore this concept as it works in practice.\r</h2>",
