It emphasizes the role of data in informing evidence-based decision-making, supporting energy policy formulation, and tracking progress toward sustainable energy goals. The module also explores the challenges associated with data quality and availability, as well as the ethical considerations related to data collection and sharing. Participants will learn about common PM&E frameworks and key performance indicators (KPIs) used in the energy sector, as well as the significance of standardized reporting frameworks in measuring and reporting on progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7). The module aims to equip UNDP Country Offices and policymakers with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively collect, analyse, and utilize energy data for driving positive change. </h2><h6>MODULE 10</h6>",

Data-driven modelling can help decision-makers understand the potential repercussions of various policy options before they are implemented, lowering uncertainty. Another important use of data in decision-making is to track progress toward energy-related targets. Regular monitoring and evaluation, supported by appropriate data, provide insights into the effectiveness of implemented measures, and allow for changes to plans as needed. </h3>",

Identifying the gap between the existing situation and the ideal vision, which is an essential stage in policymaking, requires data. For instance, data is necessary for providing information on current conditions, revealing areas for improvement, and offering actionable insights. Without a strong rationale backed up by data, the policy can potentially be inaccurately implemented and furthermore, impact people negatively. Therefore, the role of data in policy making in the energy sector is undoubtedly imperative. \n\nData can help improve transparency in the energy sector. Transparency can improve governance in the energy sector by showing the public live data and holding the stakeholders accountable. For example, providing information on energy supply and demand can give room for public organizations, such as non-governmental organizations, research centres, or any interested institutions, to identify the current energy system issues not covered by the government’s perspective and give recommendations on those issues. \n </h3><h6>Solar Power grid Integration with Data</h6><h1>UNDP defines data-driven decision-making as “the process of using data to inform your decision-making process and validate a course of action before committing to it”.\n\n  </h1><h6>Key areas of decision-making where data can make a difference</h6>",
