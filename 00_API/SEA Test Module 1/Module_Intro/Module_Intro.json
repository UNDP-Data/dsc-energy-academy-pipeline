With focus on protecting the vulnerable and fairness for the global south, it recognizes that a one-size-fits-all approach to the energy transition is not applicable.\r\n\r\nThis module delves into the concept of a Just Energy Transition and examines the transition from conventional fossil fuels to sustainable energy within decentralized systems. It highlights community-led solutions and the transformative potential of locally driven initiatives, specifically addressing social, economic, and environmental justice aspects.\r\n\r\nThe module promotes inclusive processes considering unique local and regional contexts and critically analyses the role of extractive industries in shaping energy landscapes. It underscores the need for tailored approaches, emphasizing that a one-size-fits-all approach is not applicable and recognizing variations in the path to a just energy transition based on local realities. It focuses on strategies beyond environmental considerations, highlighting worker retraining, social safety nets, and policies for economic diversification as integral components of a just transition, ensuring the prioritization of the well-being of workers and affected communities in the shift to sustainable energy sources.</h2>"
