Planning, Monitoring, 
and Evaluation
</h1><h6>Sustainable Energy Academy</h6><h4> This module provides a comprehensive understanding of the importance of data in planning, monitoring, and evaluation (PM&E) in the context of sustainable energy. It emphasizes the role of data in informing evidence-based decision-making, supporting energy policy formulation, and tracking progress toward sustainable energy goals. The module also explores the challenges associated with data quality and availability, as well as the ethical considerations related to data collection and sharing. Participants will learn about common PM&E frameworks and key performance indicators (KPIs) used in the energy sector, as well as the significance of standardized reporting frameworks in measuring and reporting on progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7). The module aims to equip UNDP Country Offices and policymakers with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively collect, analyse, and utilize energy data for driving positive change. </h4><h6>MODULE 10</h6>",

10,,T3,Text,8,"<h4>Data analysis allows decision-makers to identify patterns in energy production, use, and distribution throughout time. This historical perspective is useful in anticipating future energy-related issues and possibilities. Furthermore, data enables the modelling of many future scenarios, allowing decision-makers to simulate and analyse probable outcomes based on factors such as technological improvements, policy changes, and changes in consumer behaviour. 
 
Data is also useful in assessing the impact of various policies in the energy sector. Data-driven modelling can help decision-makers understand the potential repercussions of various policy options before they are implemented, lowering uncertainty. Another important use of data in decision-making is to track progress toward energy-related targets. Regular monitoring and evaluation, supported by appropriate data, provide insights into the effectiveness of implemented measures, and allow for changes to plans as needed. </h4>",
14,,G1,Photo,9,,
8,,T11,Text,10,"<h4>Data is vital in influencing evidence-based decision-making throughout the energy sector. Identifying the gap between the existing situation and the ideal vision, which is an essential stage in policymaking, requires data. For instance, data is necessary for providing information on current conditions, revealing areas for improvement, and offering actionable insights. Without a strong rationale backed up by data, the policy can potentially be inaccurately implemented and furthermore, impact people negatively. Therefore, the role of data in policy making in the energy sector is undoubtedly imperative. 

Data can help improve transparency in the energy sector. Transparency can improve governance in the energy sector by showing the public live data and holding the stakeholders accountable. For example, providing information on energy supply and demand can give room for public organizations, such as non-governmental organizations, research centres, or any interested institutions, to identify the current energy system issues not covered by the government’s perspective and give recommendations on those issues.

 </h1><h6>IF ONLY YOU HAVE BRAIN SPACE FOR THREE THINGS-</h6><h4>At the global level, policymakers and international organizations, such as the United Nations, World Bank, International NGOs or Multinational Energy Companies rely on comprehensive data sets to formulate energy policies, set targets, and monitor progress towards global energy goals such as emissions reduction and renewable energy deployment. Analysts and researchers utilize data for modelling and forecasting energy trends, conducting impact assessments, and identifying emerging challenges and opportunities in the global energy landscape. Traders and financial institutions leverage data for market analysis, risk management, and investment decision-making in energy markets. 
 </h4><h4>At the regional and national levels, policymakers, government agencies, and regulatory bodies use data to develop energy policies and regulations tailored to regional or national energy needs, promote energy security, and stimulate economic growth. Local governments and community organizations utilize data to plan and implement energy efficiency programs, renewable energy projects, and sustainable energy initiatives at the grassroots level. Business leaders in the energy sector rely on data for strategic planning, resource allocation, and operational decision-making to optimize energy production, distribution, and consumption. 
 </h4><h4>Individuals, including energy consumers and households, benefit from access to energy data for making informed choices about energy consumption, adopting energy-efficient technologies, and participating in demand-side management programs. Additionally, community-level stakeholders such as nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups use data to raise awareness about energy-related issues, mobilize support for policy reforms, and advocate for equitable access to energy services.

  </h1><h4>Their interests differ in energy data use, for example, the United Nations will use export and import of energy data for some countries to track its development progress. While multinational energy companies will look at the same data to find opportunities to expand their business. Even though they have various ways to use energy data, there are data related to energy that are commonly used. Based on energy system in previous figure, these data can be divided into four categories: 

      Data on energy supply
      Data on energy demand 
      Data on relevant economic indicators 
      Data on environment

Data supports policymakers starting by providing situation analysis and setting the vision for policy, evaluating the plan and implementation, and also starting over iteratively the policy cycle. </h4><h1>Data as a Core Driver of the Policy Cycle </h1><h1>2</h1><h6>selection of the transmission technology</h6>",
15,,G1,Photo,19,,
9,,T3,Text,20,"<h4>In the figure, this cycle starts with the planning stage. At this stage, the policymakers can use data to understand the situation and set the desired outcomes. Data can help build a complete picture of the issue and identify the root cause. It can help spot the gaps and potential areas that could be improved. Also, data can provide evidence of successful policies in other places, so policymakers can have a benchmark they can observe, modify, and apply in the context of the scope under their authority. Data can support the model and analyse different strategies by quantifying the costs, risks, and benefits. This analysis is necessary to ensure the policy options are the least cost and the most impactful. Data can guide policymakers in picking the fittest policy by quantifying the costs and benefits. It can also identify the risks that might appear so policymakers can minimize those risks by formulating and applying some strategies based on existing data indicators. 
 
In the second stage, monitoring, policymakers can track the progress of their goals and objectives from data. Through data analysis, they can identify trends and patterns that can strengthen or weaken the policy for achieving goals. 

Stakeholders can also evaluate the effectiveness of the policy implementation by comparing the actual and expected outcomes. In addition to that, data can also inform the public about the progress of such policy implementation, so the public can actively participate in monitoring the progress and giving feedback to policymakers. Ultimately, data can establish a mechanism for development in the energy sector that can improve the performance of policies through monitoring systems. 
 
In the evaluation stage, data is crucial as it enables evidence-based assessment that is objective, factual, and credible. Data provides concrete evidence to be assessed independently of subjective biases or opinions. This facilitates policymakers to come to conclusions whether the desired outcomes are being achieved objectively. Policymakers can evaluate which aspects of policy can be improved using data. Data-driven evaluations promote learning and continuous improvement in many areas in energy sectors. </h4><h6>Results-based management life-cycle approach</h6>",
