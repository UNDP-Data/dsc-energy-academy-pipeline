Planning, Monitoring, 
and Evaluation
</h1><h4>Sustainable Energy Academy</h4><h2> This module provides a comprehensive understanding of the importance of data in planning, monitoring, and evaluation (PM&E) in the context of sustainable energy. It emphasizes the role of data in informing evidence-based decision-making, supporting energy policy formulation, and tracking progress toward sustainable energy goals. The module also explores the challenges associated with data quality and availability, as well as the ethical considerations related to data collection and sharing. Participants will learn about common PM&E frameworks and key performance indicators (KPIs) used in the energy sector, as well as the significance of standardized reporting frameworks in measuring and reporting on progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7). The module aims to equip UNDP Country Offices and policymakers with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively collect, analyse, and utilize energy data for driving positive change. </h2><h6>MODULE 10</h6>",

SEA Test Module 1,1,Chapter 1,T3,Text,8,"<h3>Data analysis allows decision-makers to identify patterns in energy production, use, and distribution throughout time. This historical perspective is useful in anticipating future energy-related issues and possibilities. Furthermore, data enables the modelling of many future scenarios, allowing decision-makers to simulate and analyse probable outcomes based on factors such as technological improvements, policy changes, and changes in consumer behaviour. 
 
Data is also useful in assessing the impact of various policies in the energy sector. Data-driven modelling can help decision-makers understand the potential repercussions of various policy options before they are implemented, lowering uncertainty. Another important use of data in decision-making is to track progress toward energy-related targets. Regular monitoring and evaluation, supported by appropriate data, provide insights into the effectiveness of implemented measures, and allow for changes to plans as needed. </h3>",

SEA Test Module 1,1,Chapter 1,T11,Text,10,"<h3>Data is vital in influencing evidence-based decision-making throughout the energy sector. Identifying the gap between the existing situation and the ideal vision, which is an essential stage in policymaking, requires data. For instance, data is necessary for providing information on current conditions, revealing areas for improvement, and offering actionable insights. Without a strong rationale backed up by data, the policy can potentially be inaccurately implemented and furthermore, impact people negatively. Therefore, the role of data in policy making in the energy sector is undoubtedly imperative. 

Data can help improve transparency in the energy sector. Transparency can improve governance in the energy sector by showing the public live data and holding the stakeholders accountable. For example, providing information on energy supply and demand can give room for public organizations, such as non-governmental organizations, research centres, or any interested institutions, to identify the current energy system issues not covered by the government’s perspective and give recommendations on those issues.

 </h1><h6>IF ONLY YOU HAVE BRAIN SPACE FOR THREE THINGS-</h6><h3>At the global level, policymakers and international organizations, such as the United Nations, World Bank, International NGOs or Multinational Energy Companies rely on comprehensive data sets to formulate energy policies, set targets, and monitor progress towards global energy goals such as emissions reduction and renewable energy deployment. Analysts and researchers utilize data for modelling and forecasting energy trends, conducting impact assessments, and identifying emerging challenges and opportunities in the global energy landscape. Traders and financial institutions leverage data for market analysis, risk management, and investment decision-making in energy markets. 
 </h3><h3>At the regional and national levels, policymakers, government agencies, and regulatory bodies use data to develop energy policies and regulations tailored to regional or national energy needs, promote energy security, and stimulate economic growth. Local governments and community organizations utilize data to plan and implement energy efficiency programs, renewable energy projects, and sustainable energy initiatives at the grassroots level. Business leaders in the energy sector rely on data for strategic planning, resource allocation, and operational decision-making to optimize energy production, distribution, and consumption. 
 </h3><h3>Individuals, including energy consumers and households, benefit from access to energy data for making informed choices about energy consumption, adopting energy-efficient technologies, and participating in demand-side management programs. Additionally, community-level stakeholders such as nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups use data to raise awareness about energy-related issues, mobilize support for policy reforms, and advocate for equitable access to energy services.

While multinational energy companies will look at the same data to find opportunities to expand their business. Even though they have various ways to use energy data, there are data related to energy that are commonly used. Based on energy system in previous figure, these data can be divided into four categories: 

Data on energy supply
 Data on energy demand 
 Data on relevant economic indicators 
Data on environment
